### Principles of Nature

<quote><cite>There is not a word in all the songs of Solomon, which has the least relation to religion; they are descriptive of sensual love.</cite><span>— <author>Palmer, Elihu</author>, <book>Principles of nature Gb. 111</book></span></quote>

### World Religions

<quote><cite>Terms like divinity, Holy Ghost, Eucharist, prophet, omnipotence, infallibility etc are words for words’ sake and terms for terms’ sake. If we deliberate deeply on these permutation-combinations of high-sounding sounds and syllables and mean nothing verifiable. Take one of the most inspiring quotes from the Bible “I am the way, the truth and the life”, an astounding statement, which does not give away anything concrete. What is the exact meaning of the terms “way,”“truth” and “life”. Ask ten people the meaning of these fancy words and you will get twenty different answers.</cite><span>— <author>William, Xavier</author>, <book>World Religions KL 7731-7735</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Most if not all verses in any of the scriptures can be interpreted in many ways. One of the more concrete sentences in the Bible is “He took bread in his hands…this is my body…etc” There is no controversy as to the meaning of “He took bread and raised it”. However, when it comes to the statement “This is my body”…“this is my blood” there is confusion. The numerous interpretations of these simple-looking sentences have been the cause of the most number of schisms in Christianity.</cite><span>— <author>William, Xavier</author>, <book>World Religions KL 7745-7748</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Pontius Pilate has been much maligned for condemning Jesus to death. Nevertheless, from the circumstances described in the Gospels, we have to conclude he was a good administrator and a philosopher. He tried his best to save Jesus, even offering Barabas in exchange for Jesus. However, the Jews and their high priests would have none of it, and as an administrator, Pilate had his limitations. In the course of the trial, he discourses with Jesus only as a philosopher can. Jesus grows exuberant and talks of his father in heaven and his being sent by Him, which was gibberish to a foreigner like Pilate. Jesus also speaks frequently of the word, we discussed above—truth. Pilate fells Jesus with one simple question “What is truth?” Christian theologians maintain that Jesus did not answer the question due to its banality. I for one think it was the most intelligent thing that happened at the trial. Jesus was astounded by the import of the question. Even with a gifted tongue, Jesus was taken aback and tongue-tied by the question and its enormity.</cite><span>— <author>William, Xavier</author>, <book>World Religions KL 7798-7805</book></span></quote>

### The doctrine of inspiration

<quote><cite>But, in the meanwhile, if we seek for a logical answer to our question, it will not be found in Holy Writ, at least not in the form of a definition; for the Bible is written throughout in popular, familiar phraseology, and not in the way of any philosophical system. One may find many rich and imaginative descriptions in the Bible but not a single logical or scientific definition.</cite><span>— <author>Macnaught, John</author>, <book>The doctrine of inspiration p. 14</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>We know that there are modes of <i>explaining away</i> these and all other discrepancies; but we feel that they are so thoroughly unsatisfactory - not to use a stronger word - that, though they may serve as a hiding-place for the doubts of those whose conclusions.. are foregone, yet they are a terrible stumbling-block to those who bring earnest, unprejudiced minds to the examination of Scripture.</cite><span>— <author>Macnaught, John</author>, <book>The doctrine of inspiration p. 27</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Nor is it only in this case that such discrepancies manifest themselves to the careful observer. In almost every instance where two or more evangelists record the same conversation, the various interlocutors are represented as saying the exact words written; and yet the several accounts of their words differ remarkably.</cite><span>— <author>Macnaught, John</author>, <book>The doctrine of inspiration p. 38</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>At the outset, it is clear that a writing which records the narratives of miraculous events is not thereby proved to infallible. Those chronicles, for instance, which tell us of Dunstan's superhuman doings and sufferings, are not by any man supposed to be free from all admixture of error because they contain marvellous stories. Such chronicles may, indeed, be infallible; but, even to establish their credibility, they require all the more testimony, because they expect us to believe what is so unlike all that we have experienced.</cite><span>— <author>Macnaught, John</author>, <book>The doctrine of inspiration p. 72</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>From these considerations it is clear that no weight can logically attach to the complicated argument, in favour of scriptural infallibility, which is drawn from the authority calimed for Scripture by the New Testament writers. It is as futile as if one should say <i>all</i> the Pope's utterances must be infallible, because <i>he himself claims</i> infallibility as attaching to <i>some</i> of his sentences.</cite><span>— <author>Macnaught, John</author>, <book>The doctrine of inspiration p. 79</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>It may be interesting, however, to some of our readers to know, that the learned are by no means agreed that the term “Word of God,” is ever once used in Scripture as a designation of the Bible.</cite><span>— <author>Macnaught, John</author>, <book>The doctrine of inspiration p. 89</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The variations and discrepancies which occur in the accounts of what was said by Jesus, or those around him, lead us to the supposition that human tradition, and not Divine dictation, was the source from which the evangelists, at all events, draw their information.</cite><span>— <author>Macnaught, John</author>, <book>The doctrine of inspiration p. 93</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Thus, then, we conclude that these two Evangelists, and, like them, all the other New Testament writers, never dreamt of infallibility attaching to their books - never dreamt of the Spirit of God dictating their sentences; but knew well, as one of them has said, that they carefully and honestly obtained the best information they could, and then piously employed the knowledge they had acquired.</cite><span>— <author>Macnaught, John</author>, <book>The doctrine of inspiration p. 95</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>If one be asked, Why do you believe that woman was made out of man's rib? the answer is, Because the Bible, or the book of books, the greatest of all books, which is my rule (canon) of faith, tells me so. How constantly do men assume that such and such a statement cannot be erroneous, because it rests on the authority of the Bible!</cite><span>— <author>Macnought, John</author>, <book>The doctrine inspiration p. 103</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>And we have perhaps seen enough to show us that the broad distinction between canonical and uncanonical writings is one set up by the dogmatic definitions of man rather than by the actual differences which sever the two classes of composition.</cite><span>— <author>Macnought, John</author>, <book>The doctrine inspiration p. 111</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>If then all the promises of Jesus did not make Peter infallible as a religious teacher on that occasion at Antioch, what proof is there that they <i>ever</i> made him infallible either when he wrote or when he spoke?</cite><span>— <author>Macnought, John</author>, <book>The doctrine inspiration p. 121</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Once let our minds be possessed with the notion that the book, which as containing the heavenly Father's teaching we rightly call the “Word of God,” was indited by the Holy Ghost and that its human authors were merely used by that Divine person as so many pens might be used by us - that these human authors were instruments in the hands of the Spirit and not rational free agents - and it follows by an easy process of logic, if not by a necessary course of piety, that we should believe there can be no error in that which the all-knowing has penned. But is not this to lose sight of the palpable fact that the inspired writers so completely retrained their human faculties that each wrote in his own style and according to the propensity or habit of his own disposition.</cite><span>— <author>Macnought, John</author>, <book>The doctrine inspiration p. 127</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>If blemishes in the creature be not incompatible with the stupendous interference of a Divine agency in generation, why should errors in the Bible be any more incompatible with the admirable co-operation of the Divine Spirit in the writing of the Bible?</cite><span>— <author>Macnought, John</author>, <book>The doctrine inspiration pp. 128-129</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Or, again, Scripture itself teaches us that our bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost; and that, if any man love Jesus and keep his commandments, the Father and the Son will come and make their adobe with that man; and, yet, where is the man, except our Lord, who has been either impeccable or infallible?</cite><span>— <author>Macnought, John</author>, <book>The doctrine inspiration p. 129</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Does the acknowledgment of the infallibility of this one standard bind in one brotherhood of agreement Episcopalians and Presbyterians, Calvinists and Arminians, and all other sects even of Protestantism? Has not each sect, and almost every individual, its own (fallible) interpretation of the infallible Book?</cite><span>— <author>Macnought, John</author>, <book>The doctrine inspiration p. 133</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Let us, first of all, remind the reader that there is no such word as our English noun “Inspiration” either in the Hebrew of the Old Testament or in the Greek of the New.</cite><span>— <author>Macnought, John</author>, <book>The doctrine inspiration p. 140</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>If a Jew, or an early Christian, wished to say that any action was referable to some inspiration, his mode of expressing this idea was, Such and such an action was performed by such and such a spirit, good or evil, as the case might be.</cite><span>— <author>Macnought, John</author>, <book>The doctrine inspiration p. 140</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Thus our conclusion with reference to the Old Testament is that whatever was <i>good</i>, orderly, or strong... the Bible-writer attributed to the... Spirit of God whose action we designate “Inspiration”</cite><span>— <author>Macnought, John</author>, <book>The doctrine inspiration p. 150</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>In a word, if there was <i>any thing</i> which seemed <i>good</i>, in their thoughts or actions, the early Christians, like the pious Jews before them, ascribed its excellence to divine inspiration.</cite><span>— <author>Macnought, John</author>, <book>The doctrine inspiration p. 154</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>It is noticeable in connexion with the general subject of our previous chapters, that, not only does no sacred penmen claim for his <i>writings</i> the character of inspiration, but, moreover, that the very idea of Inspiration, as it was held by the Old and New Testament writers, had not the slightest connexion or even compatibility with infallibility.</cite><span>— <author>Macnought, John</author>, <book>The doctrine inspiration p. 157</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>We have moreover seen that there is no more substantial or satisfactory reason for our expecting the Bible to be free from all error than there is for our expecting that every believer, who is influenced for good only by the Spirit of Truth, must be incapable of error and sin.</cite><span>— <author>Macnought, John</author>, <book>The doctrine inspiration p. 164</book></span></quote>
