### Fanaticism

<quote><cite>The concept of fanaticism enables us not only to place a value judgement on those who oppose our ideals, but also to condemn out of hand their mode of behavior, without delving deeper, simply by saying: “They're fanatics.”</cite><span>— <author>Haynal, Molnar, Puymege</author>, <book>Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 4</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Whatever their basic personalities, they seem to have invested their entire psychological energy in the pursuit of an exclusive and absolute goal to which all else was subordinated.

<quote><cite>&lsqb;Fanaticism -&rsqb; A blind and passionate zeal born of superstitious opinions giving rise to unjust and cruel acts which are committed, not only without shame or remorse, but on the contrary with a sort of joy and relief or consolation.

<quote><cite>At the individual level, on the other hand, fanaticism resembles a state of mind where the subject is “obsessed” by a series of representations which end up taking over his entire mental space, pushing aside his former evolution.

<quote><cite>That the fanatic shares none of the animist's belief in spirits matters not at all; he will still have a narcissistic, egocentric way of thinking (he alone is always right), a belief in the omnipotence of his thought (thanks to which he will be able magically to change the world, to bring forth paradise), and finally, a projective thought which rids him of any trace of weakness and human flaw.</cite><span>— <author>Haynal, Molnar, Puymege</author>, <book>Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 41</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Human life in common is only made possible when a majority comes together which is stronger than any separate individual and which remains united against all separate individuals.

The essence of it lies in the fact that the members of the community restrict themselves in their possibilities of satisfaction, whereas the individual knew no such restrictions.</cite><span>— <author>Haynal, Molnar, Puymege</author>, <book>Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 44</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>“Manipulation of the masses” was the formula found to characterize the behavior of certain states. Thus, on the one hand, the masses are shown an enemy to bring down, with the promise that they will attain happiness... on the other hand, the organisms that traditionally monitor democratic freedoms, such as the free press, public opinion, and the parliamentary system, are ridiculed and belitted, thus eliminating the possibility of effective checks by the citizens.</cite><span>— <author>Haynal, Molnar, Puymege</author>, <book>Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 48</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The division of the world into two parties, the good and the evil, is peculiar to the thought of the fanatic. He himself is among the “good,” while evil is projected on the Other, the enemy against whom he is obliged to wage an endless struggle for self-preservation.
