UNCATALOGUED - THE GREAT WALL OF TEXT QUOTES

<quote><cite>It is useful to know something of the manners of different nations, that we may be enabled to form a more correct judgement regarding our own, and be prevented from thinking that everything contrary to our customs is ridiculous and irrational.</cite><span>— <author>Descartes, Rene</author>, <book>Discourse on Method p. 6</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>There is seldom so much perfection in works composed of many separate parts, upon which different hands had been employed, as in those completed by a single master.</cite><span>— <author>Descartes, Rene</author>, <book>Discourse on Method p. 10</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>But I had become aware, even so early as during my college life, that no opinion, however absurd and incredible, can be imagined, which has not been maintained by some one of the philosophers.</cite><span>— <author>Descartes, Rene</author>, <book>Discourse on Method p. 14</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>I commenced with the simplest and most general truths, and that thus each truth discovered was a rule available in the discovery of subsequent ones.</cite><span>— <author>Descartes, Rene</author>, <book>Discourse on Method p. 17</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>An atheist in this sense of philosophical naturalist is somebody who believes there is nothing beyond the natural, physical world, no supernatural creative intelligence lurking behind the miracles - except in the sense of natural phenomena that we don't yet understand. If there is something that appears to lie beyond the natural world as it is now imperfectly understood, we hope eventually to understand it and embrace it within the natural. As ever when we unweave a rainbow, it will not become less wonderful.</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 35</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The whole point of religious faith, its strength and chief glory, is that it does not depend on rational justification. The rest of us are expected to defend our prejudices. But ask a religious person to justify their faith and you infringe 'religious liberty.'</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard. Rushdie, Salman</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 45</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>If people wish to love a 7th century preacher more than their own families, that's up to them, but nobody else is obliged to take it seriously...</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard. Mueller</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 49</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Any creative intelligence, of sufficient complexity to design anything, comes into existence only as the end produce of an extended process of gradual evolution. Creative intelligences, being evolved, necessarily arrive late in the universe, and therefore cannot be responsible for designing it. God, in the sense defined, is a delusion; and, as later chapters will show, a pernicious delusion.</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 52</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Life is too short to bother with the distinction between one figment of the imagination and many.</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 57</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>To talk of immaterial existences is to talk of nothings. To say that the human soul, angels, god, are immaterial, is to say they are nothings, or that there is no god, no angels, no soul. I cannot reason otherwise.. without plunging into the fathomless abyss of dreams and phantasms. I am satisifed, and sufficently occupied with the things which are, without tormenting or troubling myself about those which may indeed be, but of which I have no evidence.</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard. Jefferson, Thomas.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 63</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>What is so special about believing? Isn't it just as likely that God would reward kindness, or generosity, or humility? Or sincerity?</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 131</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>A deep understanding of Darwinism teaches us to be wary of the easy assumption that design is the only alternative to chance, and teaches us to seek out graded ramps of slowly increasing complexity.</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 139</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>But the candidate solutions to the riddle of improbability are not, as is falsely implied, design and chance. They are design and natural selection... The answer is that natural selection is a cumulative process, which breaks the problem of improbability up into small pieces. Each of the small pieces is slightly improbable, but not prohibitively so... The creationist completely misses the point, because he insists on treating the genesis of statistical improbability as a single, one-off event.</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 145,147</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Creationists eagerly seek a gap in present-day knowledge or understanding. If an apparent gap is found, it is <i>assumed</i> that God, by default, must fill it.</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 151</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>One of the truly bad effects of religion is that it teaches us that it is a virtue to be satisfied with not understanding.</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 152</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one.</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 194</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>One facet of the many faces of religion is intense love focused on one supernatural person, i.e. God, plus reverence for icons of that person. Human life is driven largely by our selfish genes and by the processes of reinforcement. Much positive reinforcement derives from religion: warm and comforting feelings of being loved and protected in a dangerous world, loss of fear of death, help from the hills in response to prayer in difficult times, etc. Likewise, romantic love for another real person exhibits the same intense concentration on the other and related positive reinforcements. The state of being in love has many physiological accompaniments, such as sighing like a furnace.</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard. Smythies, John</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 215-216</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Martin Luther was well aware that reason was religion's arch-enemy, and he frequently warned of its dangers: 'Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has: it never comes to the aid of spiritual things, but more frequently than not struggles against the divine Word, treating with contempt all that emanates from God.'</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 221</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>God and Country are an unbeatable team; they break all records for oppression and bloodshed.</cite><span>— <author>Bunuel, Luis</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>And all those commandments that make reference to 'thy neighbor' are equally exclusive. 'Neighbor' means fellow Jew. Moses Maimonides, the highly respected twelfth-century rabbi and physician, expounds the full meaning of 'Thou shalt not kill' as follows: 'If one slays a single Israelite, he transgresses a negative commandment, for Scripture says, Thou shalt not murder. If one murders willfully in the presence of witnesses, he is put to death by the sword. Needless to say, one is not put to death if he kills a heathen.' Needless to say!</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 288-289</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Some of the good principles can be found in holy books, but buried alongside much else that no decent person would wish to follow: and the holy books do not supply any rules for distinguishing the good principles from the bad.</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 298</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Any modern legal system would have prosecuted Abraham for child abuse. And if he had actually carried through his plan to sacrifice Isaac, we would have convicted him of first-degree murder.</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 300</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Something has shifted in the intervening decades. It has shifted in all of us, and the shift has no connection with religion. If anything, it happens in spite of religion, not because of it.</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 304</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Npolean said, 'Religion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet,' and with Seneca the Younger: 'Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rules as useful.'</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 313</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Individual atheists may do evil things but they don't do evil things in the name of atheism.</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 315</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.</cite><span>— <author>Voltaire</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>However misguided we may think them, they are motivated... by what they perceive to be righteousness, faithfully pursuing what their religion tells them.</cite><span>— <author>Dawkins, Richard.</author>, <book>The God Delusion p. 344</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>But what happens when our ability to rationally recognize the benefits of these restrictions conflicts with an instinctive aversion to them? The degree to which we are able to strike a balance of control in our lives has a significant bearing on our health.</cite><span>— <author>Iyengar, Sheena</author>, <book>The Art of Choosing p. 14</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>In 1957 Curt Richter, a prolific psychobiology researcher at John Hopkins School of Medicine, conducted an experiment... To study the effect of water temperature on endurance.. &lsqb;he&rsqb; placed dozens of rats into glass jars - one rodent per jar - and then filled the jars with water. Because the walls of these jars were too high and slick to climb, the rats were life in a literal sink-or-swim situation. Richter even had water jets blasting from above to force the rats below the surface if they tried to float idly instead of swimming for their lives. He then measured how long the rats swam - without food, rest, or chance of escape - before they drowned... Some continued swimming for an average of 60 hours.. while others sank almost immediately. In the next round of the experiment, rather than throwing them into the water straightaway, researchers first picked up the rats several times, each time allowing them to wriggle free. After they had become accustomed to such handling, the rats were placed in the jars, blasted with water for several minutes, then removed and returned to their cages. This process was repeated multiple times. Finally the rats were put into the jars for the sink-or-swim test. This time none of the rats showed signs of giving up.. Their experience had taught them that they had some control over their outcome and, perhaps, that rescue was just around the corner.</cite><span>— <author>Iyengar, Sheena</author>, <book>The Art of Choosing p. 4-5</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Love marriage is a fundamentally individualist endeavor, while an arranged marriage is quintessentially collectivist.</cite><span>— <author>Iyengar, Sheena</author>, <book>The Art of Choosing p. 36</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Marriage inspired by love brings two people together “under the influence of the most violent, most insane, most delusive, and most transient of passions. They are required to swear that they will remain in that excited, abnormal, and exhausting condition continually until death do them part.”</cite><span>— <author>Iyengar, Sheena</author>, <book>The Art of Choosing p. 43</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Studies consistently show that money can buy happiness, but only up to a certain point. Once one's basic needs are met, the value of the additional material goods that come with greater wealth diminishes rapidly.</cite><span>— <author>Iyengar, Sheena</author>, <book>The Art of Choosing p. 132-133</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The result is that these few megacorporations decide exactly how much variety their brands will offer long before they ever reach the shelves, and its not in their interest to create true variety. Rather, they aim to maximize differences in image, thereby generating the illusion of variety and attracting the greatest diversity of consumers at the least cost to themselves.</cite><span>— <author>Iyengar, Sheena</author>, <book>The Art of Choosing p. 155</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>There are, in fact, two things, science and opinion; the former begets knowledge, the latter ignorance.</cite><span>— <author>Hippocrates</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The Scottish distiller Thomas Dewar once said, 'Minds are like parachutes. They only function when open.' On the other hand, the New York Times publisher Arthur Hays Sluzberer stated: 'I believe in an open mind, but no so open that your brains fall out.'</cite><span>— <author>Singh, Simon</author>, <book>Trick or Treatment p. 279</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>It seems to me what is called for is an exquisite balance between two conflicting needs: the most skeptical scrutiny of all hypotheses that are served up to us and at the same time a great openness to new ideas. If you are only skeptical, then no new ideas make it through to you. You never learn anything new... On the other hand, if you are open to the point of gullibility and have not an ounce of skeptical sense in you, then you cannot distinguish useful ideas from worthless ones. If all ideas have equal validity then you are lost, because then it seems to me, no ideas have any validity at all.</cite><span>— <author>Sagan, Carl</author>, <book>Lecture in Pasadena in 1987</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>No one infers a god from the simple, from the known, from what is understood, but from the complex, from the unknown, and incomprehensible. Our ignorance is God; what we know is science.</cite><span>— <author>Ingersoll, Robert</author>, <book>The Gods and Other Lectures p. 56</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>“But,” says the religionist, “you cannot explain everything; you cannot understand everything; and that which you cannot explain, that which you do not comprehend, is my God.” - We are explaining more every day. We are understanding more every day; consequently your God is growing smaller every day.</cite><span>— <author>Ingersoll, Robert</author>, <book>The Gods and Other Lectures p. 56</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Although many eminent men have endeavored to harmonize necessity and free will, the existence of evil, and the infinite power and goodness of God, they have succeeded only in producing learned and ingenious failures. Immense efforts have been made to reconcile ideas utterly inconsistent with the facts by which we are surrounded, and all persons who have failed to perceive the pretended reconciliation, have been denounced as infidels, atheists and scoffers.</cite><span>— <author>Ingersoll, Robert</author>, <book>The Gods and Other Lectures pp. 61-62</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Religious persecution springs from a due admixture of love towards God and hatred towards man.</cite><span>— <author>Ingersoll, Robert</author>, <book>The Gods and Other Lectures p. 79</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>In spite of all religion, the geologist penetrated the earth, read her history in books of stone, and found, hidden within her bosom, souvenirs of all the ages.</cite><span>— <author>Ingersoll, Robert</author>, <book>The Gods and Other Lectures p. 81</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The world is beginning to change because the people are beginning to think. To think is to advance. Everywhere the great minds are investigating the creeds and superstitions of men - the phenomena of nature, and the laws of things.</cite><span>— <author>Ingersoll, Robert</author>, <book>The Gods and Other Lectures p. 114</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The Church is, and always has been, incapable of a forward movement. Religion always looks back... Progress is born of doubt and inquiry. The Church never doubts - never inquires. To doubt is heresy - to inquire is to admit that you do not know - the Church does neither.</cite><span>— <author>Ingersoll, Robert</author>, <book>The Gods and Other Lectures p. 151-152</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Infidelity is liberty; all religion is slavery. In every creed man is the slave of God - woman is the slave of man and the sweet children are the slaves of all.</cite><span>— <author>Ingersoll, Robert</author>, <book>The Gods and Other Lectures p. 159</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Any system of religion that shocks the mind of a child cannot be a true system; the world is my country, and to do good my religion.</cite><span>— <author>Paine, Thomas</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Just in proportion that the human race has advanced, the Church has lost power. There is no exception to this rule. No nation ever materially advanced that held strictly to the religion of its founders. No nation ever gave itself wholly to the control of the Church without losing its power its honor, and existence. Every Church pretends to have found the exact truth. This is the end of progress. Why pursue that which you have? Why investigate when you know?</cite><span>— <author>Ingersoll, Robert</author>, <book>The Gods and Other Lectures p. 153</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Over the vast plain, called life, we are all travelers, and not one traveler is perfectly certain that he is going in the right direction. True it is that no other plain is so well supplied with guide-boards. At every turn and crossing you will find them, and upon each one is written the exact direction and distance. One great trouble is however, that these boards are all different, and the result is that most travelers are confused in proportion to the number they read. Thousands of people are around each of these signs, and each one is doing his best to convince the traveler that his particular board is the only one upon which the least reliance can be placed, and that if his road is taken the reward for so doing will be infinite and eternal, while all other roads are said to lead to hell, and all makers of the other guide-boards are declared to be heretics, hypocrites and liars. “Well,” says a traveler, “you may be right in what you say, but allow me at least to read some of the other directions and examine a little into their claims. I wish to rely a little upon my own judgement in a matter of so great importance.” “No, sir,” shouts the zealot, “that is the very thing you are not allowed to do. You must go my way without investigation, or you are as good as damned already.” “Well,” says the traveler, “if that is so, I believe I had better go your way.” And so most of them go along, taking the word of those who know as little as themselves. Now and then comes one who in spite of all threats, calmly examines the claims of all, and as calmly rejects them all. These travelers take roads of their own, and are denounced by all others, as infidels and atheists.</cite><span>— <author>Ingersoll, Robert</author>, <book>The Gods and Other Lectures pp. 177-179</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The truth is, our government is not founded upon the rights of gods, but upon the rights of men. Our Constitution was framed, not to declare and uphold the deity of Christ, but the sacredness of humanity. Ours is the first government made by the people and for the people. It is the only nation with which the gods have had nothing to do.</cite><span>— <author>Ingersoll, Robert</author>, <book>The Gods and Other Lectures p. 199</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The fact is, we have no national religion, and no national God; but every citizen is allowed to have a religion and a God of his own, or to reject all religions and deny the existence of all gods.</cite><span>— <author>Ingersoll, Robert</author>, <book>The Gods and Other Lectures p. 202</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Christianity cannot live in peace with any other form of faith. If that religion be true, there is but one savior, one inspired book, and but one little narrow grass-grown path that leads to heaven. Such a religion is necessarily uncompromising, unreasoning, aggressive, and insolent. Christianity has held all other creeds and forms in infinite contempt, divided the world into enemies and friends, and verified the awful declaration of its founder - a declaration that wet with blood the word he came to bring..</cite><span>— <author>Ingersoll, Robert</author>, <book>Some mistakes of Moses p. VII</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>To hate man and worship God seems to be the sum of all the creeds.</cite><span>— <author>Ingersoll, Robert</author>, <book>Some mistakes of Moses p. 15</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>To believe without evidence, or in spite of it, is accounted as righteousness to the sincere and humble Christian.</cite><span>— <author>Ingersoll, Robert</author>, <book>Some mistakes of Moses p. 19</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>It is what people do not know, that they persecute each other about. Science will bring, not a sword, but peace.</cite><span>— <author>Ingersoll, Robert</author>, <book>Some mistakes of Moses p. 28</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>But how much greater is the proportion of genius which is developed into actual results by social intercourse than by solitary reflection! The real reason for it is, that now and then a circle is formed whose members cultivate the art of mutual expression and of mutual intelligence - in other words the art of conversation - and thereby succeed in a short time in imparting to each other not merely a general knowledge of what they themselves know, but also what they themselves are.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 20</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>It will therefore be readily understood, that people of ability greatly increase that ability, and enable one another to produce great works, not merely by mutually meeting, but by cultivating the art of conversation so that they may give and take knowledge to the greatest possible advantage.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 21</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The duller the intellect and the more limited the knowledge and experience may be of the person with whom you talk, the more will he wish to hear himself, and the less will he desire to listen to you, save for applause and flattery.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation pp. 24-25</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Remember that there are few persons from whom you cannot learn something, and that everything is worth knowing.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 25</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Many people excel in courteously evading or getting rid of the conversation of others, but the lady or gentleman has mastered a much higher grade in the “art of living” who can listen with interest to all, especially to the poor and humble, without manifesting impatience, indifference or affectation of interest.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 26</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>While silent in conversation and while listening, never stare away to the right or left, and be careful to avoid all appearance of inattention or of abstractedness. Look steadily at the speaker - if he or she be a person of sense it will be an admonition to be concise, for it is not kind to compel prolonged attention from those who are so courteous as to bestow it.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 27</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Strive by every means in your power to avoid the reputation of a tattler. Never repeat to a soul a syllable which was not intended for repetition. Make it a point of personal pride to be reserved on this subject. Few persons seem to be aware of the advantages which are to be derived from having the character of never repeating anything that is told them.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 29</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>A single bit of gossip in circulation stamped with your name, will excite general distrust and doubt as to your fidelity.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 30</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Bear continually in mind the fact that in the art of conversation the secret of success lies not so much in knowing what to say, as in what to avoid saying.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 31</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>You must establish a genial and sympathetic tone between yourself and the one with whom you discourse, so that in the end your friend may retain the conviction that he has said nothing which sober second thought would disapprove, or to which you would recur with doubt.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 32</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>To be able to resolutely avoid listening to comments on the family affairs, intentions, or mistakes of other people, requires not only firmness but tact, and the one who is possessed of this will seldom be involved in difficulties resulting from avoiding gossip.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 33</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Strictly adhere to the rule of doing as you would be done by at all times, and on all occasions, firmly resisting all temptation to the contrary.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 34</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Never say anything unpleasant when it can by any possibility be avoided.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 40</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>But unfortunately very few observe the degree to which the abuses of witty sarcasm out-balance its benefits. A majority of all quarrels and ill-feelings spring from this source.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 41</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Persons who habitually tease in any manner whatever, directly or indirectly, may be possessed of many excellent qualities, but they are not entitled to true respect; nor is any one, who fails in respect towards others, or in regard for their feelings.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 44</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The whole art of pleasing is more or less directly that of complimenting.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 49</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The most benevolent or generous act to an equal, loses much of its value if utterly devoid of compliment.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 49</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Women - or men - who are not familiar with the world, or skilled in conversation, invariably express, and perhaps feel, a dislike to compliments. They are either suspicious and doubt the sincerity of all praise, or, as is more frequently the case, they find themselves unable to turn the compliment with an adroit answer or graceful reply, and are consequently rather vexed than pleased with it.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation pp. 49-50</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>All of them, however, who have any claims to culture, will, when the first tribute is paid, be best pleased with appreciative compliments paid to their intelligence, accomplishments, “spirit,” kindness of heart, tastes, habits, hopes, and associations.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 52</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>He who is continually busy with reflecting on what people think and say of each other, will be quite certain to keep a place for himself with the rest. This is the reason why in very gossiping circles there are a few efforts of genius, and few genial and earnest minds, for all is killed by reflected egotism.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 59</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Do not in conversation refer too frequently to scenes in which you have figured; to great people whom you have known; to your travels, your successes, or to anything on which you may be supposed to congratulate yourself... Do not however as some do, scrupulously avoid all mention whatever of your experiences and fortunes. There are men who carry this to an absurd degree of affection, and abstain from the slightest reference to their travels, or what they have seen, or of what they have been a part of.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation pp. 61-62</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Avoid very frequent conversation on any subject in which you are notoriously interested.

<quote><cite>Never seek to make captial in general conversation by communicating to any mortal whatever, your misfortunes, grievances and losses.

<quote><cite>One may repeat a hundred times: “be industrious! be thrifty! be enterprizing!” -- but unless the advice be accompanied with some practical illustration or application, its result will in most cases be to irritate.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 66</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Never talk simply to hear yourself talk, or for effect.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 67</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Do not tell a story unless you think it new, or are at least confident that it will be new to your auditors. Let it be in place - that is to say, illustrative of something which has occurred in conversation, for a story forced in at all hazards is very ridiculous.</cite><span>— <author>Leland, Charles Godfrey</author>, <book>The Art of Conversation p. 82</book></span></quote>

<http://ideas.ted.com/how-to-turn-small-talk-into-smart-conversation/> <quote><cite>One of Pavlov's students, Shenger-Krestovnikova, trained a dog to discriminate between a circle and an ellipse. At first the figures were very different and the dog easily learned the discrimination. Then the ellipse was made progressively more circular. Her dog was finally able to discriminate between a circle and an ellipse with axes in a ratio of 8:7. This was a remarkably acute discrimination; but, when Shenger-Krestovnikova changed the ratio to 9:8, she saw a dramatic change in the dog's behavior: “The whole behavior of the animal underwent an abrupt change. The hitherto quiet dog began to squeal on its stand, kept wriggling about, tore off with its teeth the apparatus for mechanical stimulation of the skin, and bit through the tubes connecting the animal's room with the observer, a behavior which had never happened before. On being taken into the experimental room the dog now barked violently, which was also contrary to its usual custom; in short it presented all the symptoms of acute neurosis.”</cite><span>— <author>Hothersall, David</author>, <book>History of Psychology pp. 358-359</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Some day all this will be better organized, and still better. That is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster toward the subjugation of Nature. In the end, wisely and carefully we shall re-adjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit our human needs.</cite><span>— <author>Wells, H.G.</author>, <book>The Time Machine p. 72</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>For a queer notion of Grant Allen's came into my head and amused me. If each generation dies and leaves ghosts, he argues, the world at least will get overcrowded with them. On that theory they would have become very thick in eight hundred thousand years from now, and it was no great wonder to see four all at once.</cite><span>— <author>Wells, H.G.</author>, <book>The Time Machine p. 105</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change.

<quote><cite>This is the paradox of gratitude: although the evidence is clear that cultivating gratitude in our life and in our attitude to life allows us to flourish, it can be difficult to accomplish. Developing and sustaining a grateful outlook on life is easier said than done because the choice for gratitude rarely comes without some real effort. A number of evidence-based strageties, including self-guided journaling, reflective thinking, letter writing, and gratitude visits, have shown to be effective in creating sustainable gratefulness.</cite><span>— <author>Emmons, Robert</author>, <book>Gratitude Works p. ix</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>There is frequently a divide between what we know we ought to do and how we actually wind up behaving. Psychologists call this the knowledge to performance gap.</cite><span>— <author>Emmons, Robert</author>, <book>Gratitude Works p. 6</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Simply, for example, develop a habit of looking at each thought as you would a plant. If it is worthy, if it fits the plan you desire for your mind, cultivate it. If not, replace it. How do you get it out of your mind? Simply by putting in its place two or three thoughts of love or worship, for no mind can dwell on more than two or three thoughts at one time.</cite><span>— <author>Emmons, Robert</author>, <book>Gratitude Works p. 8</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>When we lament opportunities lost or regrets over what might have been, these comparisons may be counterproductive to our mental well-being.
