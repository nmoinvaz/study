<quote><cite>'Tis not possible for any Man in his Wits (though never so much addicted to Paradoxes) to believe otherwise, but that the <i>Whole</i> is greater than the <i>Part</i>; <i>That Contradictions cannot both be true; That three and three makes six; That four is more than three</i>. </cite><span>— <author>Wilkins, John</author>, <book>Of the principles and duties of natural religion p. 60</book></span></quote>

### Racovian Catechism

<quote><cite>We ought not in every case to cry out, “I stand in my rank; here I fix my foot, and will not suffer myself to be in the least measure removed from hence." ...&lsqb;But rather each one of us ought to be&rsqb; prepared to give up his opinion when another that is better offers.</cite><span>— <author>Racovian Catechism Preface eiii</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>For it is certain that the first man was so created by God as to be endowed with free will; and there was no reason why God should deprive him of it after his fall.</cite><span>— <author>Racovian Catechism p. 325</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>For God, after having by his decree excluded from salvation a great, indeed the greatest, part of those to whom the gospel is proclaimed, does nevertheless, by the preaching of the gospel offer salvation to all; and thus acts in one way while he pretends to act in another.</cite><span>— <author>Racovian Catechism p. 333</author></span></quote>

### Thomas Jefferson

<quote><cite>This revelation has made it certain that two and one make three, and that one is not three nor can three be one. We can never be so certain of any prophecy, or the fulfillment of any prophecy, or of any miracle, or the design of any miracle, as we are from the revelation of nature, i. e., Nature’s God, that two and two are equal to four. Miracles or prophecies might frighten us out of our wits; might scare us to death; might induce us to lie, to say that we believe that two and two make five. But we should not believe it. We should know the contrary. Had you and I been forty days with Moses on Mount Sinai, and been admitted to behold the divine Shekinah, and there told that one was three and three one, we might not have had courage to deny it, but we could not have believed it.</cite><span>— <author>John Adams to Thomas Jefferson, Sep 14, 1813</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Ridicule is the only weapon which can be used against unintelligible propositions. Ideas must be distinct before reason can act upon them; and no man ever had a distinct idea of the trinity. It is mere Abracadabra of the mountebanks calling themselves the priests of Jesus.</cite><span>— <author>Thomas Jefferson to Van der Kemp, 1816</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The Presbyterian clergy are loudest, the most intolerant of all sects, the most tyrannical, and ambitious; ready at the word of the lawgiver, if such a word could be now obtained, to put the torch to the pile, and to rekindle in this virgin hemisphere, the flames in which their oracle Calvin consumed the poor Servetus, because he could not find in his Euclid the proposition which has demonstrated that three are one, and one is three, nor subscribe to that of Calvin that magistrates have a right to exterminate all heretics to Calvinistic creed.</cite><span>— <author>Jefferson, letter to William Short, April 13, 1820</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>I can never join Calvin in addressing his god. He was indeed an Atheist, which I can never be; or rather his religion was Daemonism. If ever man worshiped a false god, he did. The being described in his 5 points is not the god whom you and I acknowledge and adore, the Creator and benevolent and governor of the world, but a daemon of malignant spirit. It would be more pardonable to believe in no god at all, than to blaspheme him by the atrocious attributes of Calvin.</cite><span>— <author>Jefferson, Letter to John Adams, April 11, 1823</author></span></quote>

### An History of Corruption on Christianity

<quote><cite>Theodosius, in whose reign persecution for the sake of religion made greater advances than in any other within this period.. Immediately upon his baptism, which according to the superstitious notions which influenced many persons of that age, he had deferred till his life was in danger by sickness, he published a decree commanding that, “in order that all his subjects should make profession of the same religion which the divine apostle Peter taught the Romans, the doctrine of the Trinity should be embraced by those who would be called catholics; that all others,” whom he says he judged to be mad, “should bear the infamous name of heretics, and that their assemblies should not be called churches, reserving their farther punishment in the first place to the vengeance of heaven”</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book>An History of Corruption on Christianity pp. 173-174</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Theodosius, who in 448 made a law, by which it was ordered, that all books, the doctrine of which was not conformable to the councils of Nice and Ephsus, and also to the decisions of Cyril, should be destroyed, and the concealers of them put to death.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book>An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 177</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Calvin went upon the same plan, persecuting many worthy persons, and even procuring Servetus to be burned alive for writing against the doctrine of the Trinity. He also wrote a treatise in order to prove the lawfulness of putting heretics to death</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book>An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 192</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The Arian controversy afforded the bishops of Rome several opportunities of extending their power. Athanasius himself engaged the protection of pope Julius; and it was chiefly by the influence of the see of Rome that the trinitiarian doctrine came to be established.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book>An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 285</book></span></quote>

### Antitrinitarian Biography

<quote><cite>What rule of language, it can be correct to say, that the Father is a divine person, the Son is a divine person, and the Holy Ghost is a divine person, and therefore there are three divine persons; and yet when it is asserted, that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, it should at the same time be denied that there are three Gods?</cite><span>— <author>Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 240</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>A natural contradiction implies an inconsistency, and impossibility, in the nature of the thing describe, as there described; a numerical contradiction is an error, committed in the summing up of things.</cite><span>— <author>Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 281</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>He lays it down, as a principle, that a man, who is obliged to believe a thing, must know what that thing is, before he can believe it. He contends, that a person can neither affirm, nor deny, --- believe, nor disbelieve a proposition, which he does not understand; that it is impossible to assert something of nothing, or of that respecting which we have no idea; and that a man may as well be required to do a thing, when he knows not what it is that he has to do, as to believe, when he cannot comprehend what he is to believe.</cite><span>— <author>Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 287</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>It advanceth and so fully proveth this point, <i>That Christ and his Apostles did not propound any Articles as necessarily to be believed to make a man a Christian, but this, That Jesus is the Christ, or Messias</i>, I think it may with great justice be rupted one of the best books that hath been published for at least these sixteen hundred years. The main points for which he contends are, that Christ and his Apostles required no further profession, than that Jesus was the Messiah; that the primitive Christians suffered solely on account of this profession, and not for their faith in any particular doctrines; and that it is antichristian to insist upon anything, as a part of the religion of Jesus, which Jesus himself has not authorized.</cite><span>— <author>Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 314-315</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>...the reasons why we affirm, that from eternity there was but One God, the Creator of the universe. If from eternity there have been two or more Gods, either they are united in one and the same essence, or each of them has a distinct essence to himself. But for them to exist in one and the same essence, is impossible; for though they should be one in their denomination of gods, yet as begotten and unbegotten they must be different: seeing what is begotten resembles its parent, whereas the unbegotten is like nothing, being neither made of, nor for anything. But if it should be said that many gods are one, as the hand, foot and eye are but parts of the same body, Socrates will tell you, that what is compounded of, and divisible in parts, is both made and corruptible. But God is uncreated, impassible, and undivisible, therefore not consisting of parts.</cite><span>— <author>Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 325-326</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>They &lsqb;early Unitarians&rsqb; were known by the name of Anabaptists, because they agreed with that sect on the subject of Baptism; but their opinions were entitled to much more weight, and were the result of more deliberate and profound thought, than those of the German and Dutch Anabaptists. They objected to the doctrine of the Trinity...</cite><span>— <author>Antitrinitarian Biography Vol II</author></span></quote>

### Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends

<quote><cite>And when I look around me, and observe how the great majority of mankind are blindly following the lead of others, how few there are who think for themselves, how few are willing to test their religious opinions by comparing them with other systems of faith, by bringing them all to “the law and the testimony” of God’s inspired word</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends IV</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>At this age of the world, a rational religion is certainly needed to counteract the prevalence of infidelity; and nothing but a rational religion will do this. Those in high places may sound the alarm, if they please, and tell us that it is dangerous to use our <i>reason</i> in matter of religion, but it will all be in vain.</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends V</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>I conscientiously and firmly reject the doctrine of the Trinity… I received it, as many others do, without thorough investigation, though, I must confess, it has often perplexed me beyond measure. Still I held it, as it seems to me all must do, as a strange mystery, which I must not attempt to comprehend</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 2</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>From this address &lsqb;John 20:28&rsqb; of Thomas, many commentators are of the opinion, that the doctrine of Christ’s divine nature may be established, and conceive that the sentence, when filled up, would be thus: ‘I am not faithless; I doubt no longer; thou art my Lord and my God.’ But, on the contrary, others justly observe, that Thomas used the term God in the sense in which it is applied to kings and judges, who were considered as representatives of Deity, and preeminently to the Messiah.</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 22</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Again, he says, that they who style themselves orthodox “constantly assert, that the will, power and wisdom of the whole Trinity is one and the same; and that what one wills, does, and knows, they all will do and know, by virtue of this unity of essence.” Again, “that where the numerical essence is one and the same, the will and actions of that essence must be one and the same. And where the will and actions are numerically distinct and diverse, there the individual essence must also be distinct and different. And this Damascen declares to be the doctrine of the holy Fathers. Hence, it demonstratively follows, that of the essence of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, be numerically one and the same, the will and all the other actions of these three, must be numerically one and the same; so that, what the Father wills and does, the Son and Holy Ghost must will and do also… If the three persons in the Trinity have one mind and will, how could Christ say he came not to do his own will, but the will of him that sent him? “I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which sent me.”</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 30</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Bear in mind also that the term worship… was used in the early ages of the Church with as great latitude as the term God, and did no more <i>always</i> mean <i>supreme</i> homage than the term God <i>always</i> meant the <i>supreme</i> Being. Nebuchadnezzar “fell upon his face and <i>worshipped</i> Daniel,” but not as the supreme God; and the eastern sages worshipped the infant Jesus, but not as the supreme God.</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 33</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>First, that Watts did not believe the Trinity, as usually understood, to be ‘plainly taught in any single text;’ secondly, that in his mind it was not so expressed in the Scriptures at large as to be intelligible to ‘reason and conscience;’ and thirdly, that the ‘strange and perplexing notion of three real persons going to make up one true God,’ is not a ‘necessary and important part of the Christian doctrine,’ whatever may be thought of its reality.</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 54-55</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Namely that the early Fathers did not believe that the Trinity was taught in Scriptures, and that those who believed in and contended for this doctrine themselves, did not receive it as it is received at the present day.</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 54-59</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Human nature – nature as it exists in the bosom of an infant – is nothing else but capability; capability of good as well as evil, though more likely from its exposures, to be evil than good.</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 66</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Those who receive the doctrine of the Trinity are the persons who are depending upon human reason. It appears to me they fall into two strange and opposite errors. They first construct the doctrine upon inference and human reason, and then they prostrate reason to receive it.</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 78</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>But when all you say amounts to this, we are right, and you are wrong – you are blind, but we can see; I acknowledge that I am not in a fair way to be convinced.</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 79</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>In the New Testament I constantly find that men where commanded to believe that the Messiah was the Son of God; but in the present day a very different faith is required of us. Instead of saying, “I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God,” men are required to say, “I believe that thou art the living God himself.”</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 92</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>I not long ago heard two orthodox divines of the Calvinistic school congratulating themselves upon the perfection of their system, remarking that they prized it because all the parts of it “dovetailed” together so nicely. Yes, Sir, it is certain they do dovetail in a beautiful manner, but it is only as a system of human invention that they do so; they certainly do not harmonize with human reason, nor, it is plain to me, with Scripture; certainly not with the character of God as revealed to us in the Bible.</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 108</book></span></quote>

### Principles of nature

<quote><cite>If the assertion be made, that one is equal to three, and that three are no more than one, all numerical distinction is totally destroyed, and man consents to become a fool upon the plainest points. Trinitarian declarations are direct contradictions to each other; the part is as great as the whole, and the whole is no greater than the part; three infinites put together make only one, and the destruction of two of them does not diminish the mass of existence or perfection.</cite><span>— <author>Palmer, Elihu</author>, <book>Principles of nature p. 17-18</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>This doctrine of the Trinity, Christianity has borrowed from the ancient heathen ideas, and the church has incorporated it for the purposes of mystery and ecclesiastical imposition. It was found among the reveries of Plato, and being transferred to the followers of Jesus, it has appeared under the modification, and with the names of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Thus modified, it became the foundation of a cruel and ferocious dogma, that external damnation should be the portion of him who called in question this holy mystery.</cite><span>— <author>Palmer, Elihu</author>, <book>Principles of nature p. 18</book></span></quote>

### Reasons for not believing the doctrines of the Trinitarians

<quote><cite>Beings, whose existence is dependent on the will of another, cannot be equal in power to the being on whom they depend.</cite><span>— <author>Andrews, Norton</author>, <book>Reasons for not believing the doctrines of the Trinitarians p. 8</book></span></quote>

### The Age of Reason

<quote><cite>As to the Christian system of faith, it appears to me as a species of atheism - a sort of religious denial of God. It professes to believe in a man rather than in God. It is a compound made up chiefly of manism with but little deism.</cite><span>— <author>Paine, Thomas</author>, <book>The age of reason p. 29</book></span></quote>

### World Religions

<quote><cite>If Jesus is God, any god can do what he did and forgive his tormentors and so Jesus does not deserve any credit for what he did. On the other hand, if he is an ordinary human being like us with our own frailties and shortcomings, then he deserves to be admired and emulated. By making him a God, the vested interests have taken the shine off the glory of his humanity.</cite><span>— <author>William, Xavier</author>, <book>World Religions KL 7831-7833</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The Christian doctrine of the trinity -- Father, Son, and Holy Ghost -- was not formalized until the 4th or 5th century C. E. (A), yet the historical concept of a triune deity is much older than that, with evidence dating from the 7th millenium B.C.E. (B). Even in early Christianity, this trinity had a female member, the Holy Ghost.</cite><span>— <author><a href='http://www.northernway.org/twm/mary/trinity.html'>Mary and the Trinity</a></author></span></quote>
