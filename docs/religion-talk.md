### Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion

<quote><cite>When the heathens worshiped their superior divinities, who were supposed to have their residence above the clouds, they did it not only on mountains, and in high places but on high altars, thinking that by that means they had a nearer access to the objects of their worship.
