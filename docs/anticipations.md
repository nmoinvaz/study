### Automation

The human race has continued to demand more and more of itself. Our productivity has increased leaps and bounds from what it was only a few hundred years ago.

Evolution appears to be moving toward ever increasing complexities. Humanity itself may simply be one step in the chain of evolutionary complexity. That is not to dismiss humanity, as that single step may be one of the most important steps. The complexities of our universe have brought us forth, it is therefore only natural that our complexities should bring forth another even more complex and even more intelligent that ourselves. In other words, it is very possible that humanity, the highest known natural complexity, should become the father to the next chain of evolutionary complexity, the first chain of selective complexity.

The division of labor

The productivity of civilization has been ever increasing. Each new methodology The industrial age saw a huge increase in productivity through the division of labor.

The industrial age

The division of labor was one of the highest contributing factors

Automation has been used in the past few decades primarily by big corporations to do repetitive tasks in assembly line manufacturing. With the introduction of the division of labor, which allowed single tasks to be broken down into their specialized component tasks, it has led to an increase in the productivity of the manufacturing sector.

As the population continues to grow, and with it demand for more product, the manufacturing sector will not be able to meet the demand by relying on human labor. The most highly skilled human will not be able to keep up with the speed of the demand. Therefore, it has been necessary for the divided labor to worked by machine.

In the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith talked about the division of labor and how it allowed more complex

Automation is being utilized by big corporations to do repetitive tasks.

Automation as it exists currently has been reserved for manufacturers who can afford to pay for its development. It costs a hefty sum of both time and money to to build a robot and then to program to do specific tasks. In the not too distant future, automation will be
