Government
==========

*Inadequate representation* is a source of a lot of problems in our government. The first amendment proposed on the Bill of Rights would have guaranteed proper representation, but it was never ratified.

*Corrupt representation* is another source of problems in our government.

The founders of the United States envisioned three branches of government as a system of checks and balances. But as time has gone by, that system of checks and balances has eroded. Organizations that allow insiders to leak information to the public serve as an additional check and balance to corruption. That is why it is important for an organization like Wikileaks to exist — as a final check and balance.

### Political Parties

A _party_ seems to me to be nothing more than a new word for an old word: _sect_. The old word was used to describe a group of people who held a certain religious belief and the new word is used to describe a group of people who hold a certain political belief. In this way, I think that political parties share much in common with religious sects. Both of them represent a ready-made set of beliefs that adherents can subscribe to. They are beliefs regarding a particular view of the world packaged together in a single _doctrine_.

To _mobilize_ a group of people for a single purpose takes more than a doctrine though. It is not enough for the words to exist on the pages of a 2,000 year old book. They must be brought to life by a charismatic leader without which they might otherwise be forgotten. And the way they are brought to life is by employing them in _rhetoric_ that taps into the emotions of whoever is listening. In religion, the fear of everlasting torments or damnation is used to control the behavior of the group. And in politics, the fear of life under the control of the opposition is used to motive the group to vote.

Every _group_ that comes together for a joined purpose will begin to _think_ in a similar fashion given the right conditions. It is the process of _achieving a shared goal_ that causes the minds of the individuals in the group to align often times with a _shared identity_. In groups where nothing is achieved there are many discords. When _new ideas_ are presented to a group that call into question its identity or the group _fails to achieve_ its intended goal the whole group can undergo massive cognitive dissonance. The operations and results of _group think_ are the same in both political and religious spheres.

In the same way that much of humanity got tired of religious sects, I hope they will also get tired of political parties. Perhaps the only system of government that has the potential to remove the party from politics is one where the people are directly represented by themselves rather than through proxy representation. Given the state of technology at this current time, I don’t think it is unreasonable that such a system of self-government could exist.
