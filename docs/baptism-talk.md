### The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance

<quote><cite>It is “the ingrafted word which is able to save” the soul, James 1:21. Christ sanctifies and cleanses the church “with the washing of water by the word,” Eph v. 26. This “ingrafted word,” this sanctifying “washing of water by the word” is all inward and spiritual. It is the antitype of the divers washings under Moses, and equally so of water baptism, in every form. This cleanses the soul, as outward water does the body, and puts away the filth of the spirit, as that does the filth of the flesh.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 7-8</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>He did not breathe on his disciples, and baptize them with the Holy Ghost, to qualify them to baptize others in water.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 12</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>John had, as he baptized the people, diligently preached the kingdom at hand, not yet fully come, and taught them to look beyond his outward, to Christ’s inward and saving baptism.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 16</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The Father Almighty, in his unlimited goodness, and good will to men, took special care that John, the preparer of his way, in the power and spirit of Elias, should be expressly sent before him, baptizing in water, as a lively resemblance and representation of his great work, in thoroughly cleansing the floor of the heart.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 21</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>And hence I think it generally holds good, that those who are very tenacious of them, most zealous in their use, urge them the most pressingly on others, and most liberally censure and condemn those, who, believing them to be no gospel ordinances, conscientiously decline them; are less livingly sensible of the life and substance.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 25</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Paul told the Galatians, “if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing,” Gal v. 2. This must amount of thus much at least, that in proportion as they relied on, or were taken up with attention to that outward performance, they were diverted from Christ – and this is just as true of water baptism, and every other outward symbol.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 27</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>And I am sorry to perceive such numbers of professing Christians striving so hard, as I think they do, to make these things serve as a substitute for that which is saving. They evidently substitute water baptism instead of Christ’s; for they do not scruple to call it the one baptism of the gospel. They expressly maintain it to be Christ’s, and apply it to many texts which evidently speak of far deeper matters; as baptism into Christ, into his death, &c. and that which speaks of the baptism which now saves us, although the text itself declares it is not the putting away of the filth of the flesh (the proper work of water) yet they insist it is water; and so make it out, if they substantially make out any thing by it, that a figure saves us.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 27-28</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Having seen that Christ’s baptism in the figure could only be suffered; seeing the figures precede, point to, but belong not to the gospel, and that now, before the figurative dispensation was abolished, was the only proper and acceptable time for it.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 30</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Paul says, “circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing,” 1 Cor. Vii. 19; and it holds equally in outward baptism, and the supper – If one shadow were any thing in the gospel, another might as well be something – Circumcision would be as much something as baptism – The gospel excludes them all.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 33</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>For this baptism was now so evidently dispensed through Peter’s preaching , that he immediately remembered this precious promise of our blessed Lord – which had been very illy applied by him to the Holy Ghost falling on them</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 54}</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Indeed the very query, “can any man forbid water?” &c. Acts 10:47, is an appeal to men, and bespeaks a state of hesitation, or uncertainty.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 55}</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>we do not read, that, “finding fault”, with the rites, figures and ordinances of the first covenant, God ordained water-washing, and eating and drinking bread and wine, as more permanent and perpetual institutions of the new or second covenant - Nay, verily, he finds fault equally with all things in their own nature equally partaking of the same weakness</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 78-79}}</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Why then continue a baptism that was expressly unto repentance, for the remission of sins, if we have obtained remission?</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 81</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>We read expressly, that he directed one to go and offer for his cleansing “the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them,” Mat. viii. 4. Another he ordered to “go wash in the pool of Siloam,” John ix. 7: but not an instance of any one ordered by him to be baptized by another in water. But had water baptism been his, or any part of his gospel, it would have been a strange thing indeed had he never vouchsafed once to administer it, nor order it done on any of the multitudes that believed on him, or out of whom he cast devils, or whom he healed.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 95</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Nor did Christ, when he came, ever once, that we read of, call that of water his baptism.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 97</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>And yet this sensible author will not allow any thing at all in it, or to be understood, or even implied in it, but what Christ fully and plainly declared his mind about: and then queries, “where has Jesus Christ declared his mind, and declared it fully and plainly, that infants are to receive Christian baptism?” Now, serious reader, let us just vary the terms of this question, and ask, “where has Jesus Christ declared his mind fully and plainly - nay, where has he declared it at all, that adults are to be baptized in water? or where has he ever declared material water to be his baptism?” I believe the text where he has declared this is not in the Bible, any more tan the other.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 108</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>But he goes on, and asks, “is not our Savior's commission far from declaring fully and plainly in favour of children's baptism, perfectly silent on this head?” And I ask, is it not as perfectly silent about water?</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 108-109</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>But prejudice has such a powerful influence, that many texts are read and quoted in support of elementary water, which speak only of the spiritual water of the word.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 111</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Now there is but “one Lord, one faith, and one baptism,” belonging to the Christian dispensation -- but here this author, three times, mentions expressly both the baptism of the Spirit, or Holy Ghost, and the baptism of water, as distinct things, as two baptisms, and urges them, being both used in the case of Cornelius, as proof that water baptism belongs to the gospel -- Will he say, Christ instituted two baptisms? If not, as here where two are mentioned, it is plain one only of them was Christ's. If Christ's is but one and that one be not Christ's, but, as the Quaker says, was John's. On the other hand, if Christ's is but one, and the one be immersions in elementary water, then that of the Holy Ghost is not Christ's -- So that this instance, instead of proving water baptism to be Christ's proves quite the contrary.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 114-115</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Ananias was sent to Paul expressly, Acts 9:17, that he might “be filled with the Holy Ghost.” Then surely he instrumentally dispensed or ministered it to him, or (which is the same thing) baptized him with it.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 122</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Some contend against baptizing spiritually by teaching in the power of the gospel, and urge that the gift of tongues always attended baptism of the Holy ghost. If so, who have this baptism in our day? Will it be granted that none are now baptized with the baptism of Christ?</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 122-123</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Is water baptism once called Christ's in all the Bible? Is it once called a gospel ordinance? Did Christ ever practice it? Was John's baptism Christ's? If not, were Christ's twelve disciples ever baptized with Christ's baptism, or not? If Christ's is water, and yet not the same of john's, who baptized these Apostles, seeing Jesus baptized none in water?</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 135</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>If Christ had ordained water baptism, he would have administered it to those he sent to administer it to others. And I rest firmly persuaded he never did ordain it, but that all the water baptism now practiced among Christians is derived from John, or else is altogether, unauthorized in the New Testament. And why do those who now use it, use a form of words never once used by any of the Apostles? If they say Christ commanded it, then why did not his Apostles obey his command?</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 138</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>It is urged by some, that putting on Christ, which all do who are baptized into him, Gal iii. 27, is giving up their names to Christ in water baptism: but of those baptized into Christ, in the Apostle's sense, he here declares, “ye are all in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ's then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise,” 28, 29; that is real heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ. This certainly is not true of as many as are baptized into water, though it certainly is true of as may as are baptized into Christ. Putting on Christ is therefore plainly thus, “put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.” Rom. xiii. 14.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 138</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>...and Israel's passage through the sea is a figure of that figure; or that the Apostle, in his assertion here, that they were baptized, only had an allusion to that figure, I see not how he could positively in truth say, they were baptized.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 145</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>At any rate, and turn it every way, will not the result be, either that Paul did not mean as he said, that they really were baptized, but only that their passage resembled baptism, and may bear an allusion to it, or that he meant an outward baptism, without either dipping or sprinkling, or that he meant an inward and spiritual baptism?</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 146</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Thus men by attachment to rituals, are liable to have their minds veiled, from beholding the obviously inward and spiritual meaning of scripture, or at least turned to seek or suppose an outward signification, where none seems necessary or intended, but that which centers in the life and substance.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 166</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>He was for the life; they the letter. He for the substance; they, the symbols.</cite><span>— <author>Scott, Job</author>, <book>The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 172</book></span></quote>

### Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual

<quote><cite>The idea which is here brought out as common to the outpouring of water and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, is evidently a <i>reviving or life-producing power</i>.</cite><span>— <author>MacNair, Robert</author>, <book>Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 12</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>But on further examining the passages adduced, we find that the object is not to draw out an analogy between water and the Holy Spirit, but to set forth <i>spiritual truths under the figure of the natural</i>...</cite><span>— <author>MacNair, Robert</author>, <book>Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 14</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The time for administering water-baptism was then present; the time for administering spiritual baptism was then future.</cite><span>— <author>MacNair, Robert</author>, <book>Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 18</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>How is it that with all the pains they have been at to tell us water-baptism is not the only baptism, we still understand them by the simple word baptize to refer to water-baptism? For this reason, that they are speaking of baptism as an existing fact, and their own narratives teach us that of the two kinds they had mentioned, water-baptism was the only one which then had a being. Till the time when the Spirit is given, they are safe in using the word baptism, even without an adjunct, as equivalent to water-baptism.</cite><span>— <author>MacNair, Robert</author>, <book>Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 19-20</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Now, if we read the passage in the text in like manner, it will be, the prophets and the law prophesied until John, he being the last prophet under the old economy, not the first of a new.</cite><span>— <author>MacNair, Robert</author>, <book>Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 27</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>When asked why he &lsqb;John&rsqb; baptized though he was not the Christ, his justification he bases upon this, “I baptize with water.”</cite><span>— <author>MacNair, Robert</author>, <book>Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 37</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>John’s baptism must include both of these characters, and might therefore be expressed thus, a baptism with water, in which the subject is called upon to exercise repentance.</cite><span>— <author>MacNair, Robert</author>, <book>Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 37</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>We find in the use of language, that words often acquire secondary meanings, in which all trace of the original idea is lost sight of. Supposing that the word baptism meant originally cleansing, but that this cleansing was ordinarily effected by immersion, it would not be unparalleled to have a new application of the word, in which the idea of cleansing was dropped, and only that of immersion appeared.</cite><span>— <author>MacNair, Robert</author>, <book>Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 40</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The experiment of ritual worship has been tried on a large scale. It answered the purpose for which it was established, but it has failed to effect a radical change in human nature… “For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did”… God has offered man a spiritual religion. But he longs for a ritual.</cite><span>— <author>MacNair, Robert</author>, <book>Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 49</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>But the very same circumstances which have rendered the sign of sacrifice obsolete render every other sign of a similar texture inappropriate. The sign of sacrifice was a testimony to the fact of an atonement not yet effected. The sign was a witness that the thing signified was yet future, and loses its meaning when this becomes present.</cite><span>— <author>MacNair, Robert</author>, <book>Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 54</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>He adds that &lsqb;the word&rsqb; religion was once used predominantly “for the outward service of God”.</cite><span>— <author>MacNair, Robert</author>, <book>Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 58</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The man who is sealed with the Spirit, who worships God in the spirit, who is circumcised in heart, is the man who has been initiated into the Church of Jesus Christ.</cite><span>— <author>MacNair, Robert</author>, <book>Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 60</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>But yet believers were to do greater works than Jesus had done. How? I answer, by baptizing with the Spirit, which he had not done when he spake these words.</cite><span>— <author>MacNair, Robert</author>, <book>Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 82</book></span></quote>

### An History of Corruption on Christianity

<quote><cite>It was natural therefore, for the apostles, and other Jews, on the institution of baptism, to apply it to infants, as well as to adults, as a token of the profession of christianity by the master of the family only; and this they would do without considering it as a substitute for circumcision, and succeeding in the place of it, which it is never said to do in the scriptures, though some have been led by some circumstances of resemblance in the two rites to imagine this was the case.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book>An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 71</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>There is this difference with respect to the corruptions of the rite of baptism, and those of the Lord's supper, that though they both began about the same time, and those relating to baptism were perhaps the earlier of the two, and the progress of superstition in consequence of this corruption, was rather more rapid in the first century of christianity, it was by no means so afterwards.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book>An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 79</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Wycliffe thought baptism to be necessary to salavation. “The priest,” he says, “in baptism administers only the token or sign, but God, who is the priest and bishop of our souls, administers the spiritual grace.” And Luther not only retained the rite of baptism, but even the ceremony of exorcism.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book>An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 91</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Those of the early Fathers who ascribed the least to the rite of baptism, supposed that by it was done away whatever inconvenience mankind had been subjected to in consequence of the fall of Adam; so that they made a great difference between the case of those children who died baptized, and those who died unbaptized</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book>An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 200</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite><poem>No, men desire others to make a fair shew in the flesh constraining them to be water baptized that they might glory in their flesh.

Galatians 6:12-13 KJV - As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. 13 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.

Yes, the Galatians were being constrained to be circumcised just as today men constrain others to be water baptized. The why it is the same\~that they may glory in your flesh.</poem> </cite><span>— <author>Baptism in Romans [^1]</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite><poem>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.

Galatians 3:27-28 KJV For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

Neither male nor female? I don't see anyone coming up out of the water neither male nor female. It is a baptism (identification) into Christ's death (Romans 6), baptized into Christ. It is BY one Spirit into one body. It cannot be accomplished by water.

You cannot just put water in everytime you see the word baptism. There is more than one baptism in the Bible too.</poem> </cite><span>— <author>Baptism in Romans [^2]</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The ordinances of purification in the Levitical law relate especially to the removal of legal uncleanness connected with childbirth, death, and other pollutions. Washing was prescribed for such purposes, and also sprinkling with water of separation, water mingled with the ashes of the red heifer. Ablution formed part of the consecration of priests and without it they might not serve at the altar nor enter the tabernacle. In later times of Jewish national history, perhaps through the intercourse with nations whose lustrations entered more into the daily routine of life, ceremonial washings were multiplied.</cite><span>— <author>Tylor, Edward B</author>, <book>Primitive culture p. 440</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Can water, externally applied, destroy internal moral turpitude? If human vices could be cured through this channel, the more rational efforts for the renovation and improvement of our character would become unnecessary. But it is clearly discernable, that as vice is a violation of moral law, the way to remedy the mischiefs resulting from this violation, is not to pour water on the face, which can have no possible influence on the mind, but to return to uniform conduct, consistent with the primary principles of moral virtue.</cite><span>— <author>Palmer, Elihu</author>, <book>Principles of nature p. 45</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Regarding 1 Peter 3:21, the notes in the The Hebrew-Greek Key Study Bible (pages 1539-1540) explains, “The expression ‘baptism doth now save’ should be understood in light of verse twenty: ‘eight souls were saved by water.’ KJV’s “by water” is incorrect; the Greek is “through water (di udatos)” per (NKJV, NIV, NASB, Green’s Literal Translation, NRSV).</cite><span>— <author>Faith Facts</author>, <book><a href='http://www.faithfacts.org/world-religions-and-theology/101-reasons-baptism-not-necessary-for-salvation'>101 Reasons Why Water Baptism is Not Necessary to be Saved</a></book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Acts 22:16 says, “Now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.” According to the John MacArthur study Bible, “Grammatically the phrase, ‘calling on His name,’ precedes ‘Get up and be baptized.’ Salvation comes from calling on the name of the Lord (Romans 10:9, 10, 13), not from being baptized.”</cite><span>— <author>Faith Facts</author>, <book><a href='http://www.faithfacts.org/world-religions-and-theology/101-reasons-baptism-not-necessary-for-salvation'>101 Reasons Why Water Baptism is Not Necessary to be Saved</a></book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>66. The Holy Spirit is the seal of the believer’s salvation (Eph. 4:30; 2 Cor. 1:22; Rom. 8:9), not water baptism.

<quote><cite>101. And finally, for the record, the word baptism does not necessarily always mean immersion. For example, in 1 Corinthians 10:1-4 the Israelites were baptized by only getting their feet wet, while it was the Egyptians who got immersed. Luke 11:38 is a reference to the washing of hands, not of total body immersion. In Mark 7:4 baptism is described as washing of vessels, which is not necessarily immersion but could be pouring or scrubbing. Hebrews 9:10 speaks of “various ceremonial washings.” The word here is baptismos. The ceremonial washing, or baptisms, that follow are rites of purification in the Old Testament (cf. Heb 9:13-31). In all of these ceremonial washings, the method of application was sprinkling. In fact, all Old Testament purifications or washings were by sprinkling (Numbers 8:7, 19:19, Lev 14:7, etc).</cite><span>— <author>Faith Facts</author>, <book><a href='http://www.faithfacts.org/world-religions-and-theology/101-reasons-baptism-not-necessary-for-salvation'>101 Reasons Why Water Baptism is Not Necessary to be Saved</a></book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Some proponents of baptism for salvation at this point will assert that the means of appropriating salvation are different before and after the cross to try and discount these examples of Christ. There is no scriptural evidence at all that the means of appropriating salvation changed after the death and resurrection of Christ. In fact, scripture strongly concludes that the mode of salvation has always been through faith.</cite><span>— <author>Shimer, Ted</author>, <book><a href='http://www.stumo.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Why-Baptism-is-Not-Necessary-for-Salvation.pdf'>Why Baptism is not Necessary for Salvation</a></book></span></quote>
