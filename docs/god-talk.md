### Principles of nature

<quote><cite>Moses, Zoraster, Jesus, and Mahomet, are names celebrated in history; but what are they celebrated for? Have their institutions softened the savage ferocity of man? have they developed a clear system of principle, either moral, scientific, or philosophical? Have they encouraged the free and unqualified operation of intellect, or, rather, by their institutions, has not a gloom been thrown over the clearest subjects, and their examination prohibited under the severest penalties? The successors and followers of these men have adhered to the destructive lessons of their masters with undeviating tenacity. This has formed one of the most powerful obstacles to the progress of improvement, and still threatens, with external <i>damnation</i>, that man who shall call in question the truth of their <i>dogmas</i>, or the divinity of their systems.</cite><span>— <author>Palmer, Elihu</author>, <book>Principles of nature p. 8</book></span></quote>

The world becomes a field of blood, and man is slaughtered in the name of Heaven.</cite><span>— <author>Palmer, Elihu</author>, <book>Principles of nature p. 12</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>This variegated groupe of gods, devils, angels, ghosts, and witches, is what constitutes essentially the supernatural theology, or rather mythology of the Christian world.

<quote><cite>It is strange to observe, that in reasoning upon theological subjects, men are disposed to abandon the correct ground of moral decision, and contend that those actions which would be unjust in man, would nevertheless be just when performed by the Creator.</cite><span>— <author>Palmer, Elihu</author>, <book>Principles of nature Gb. 110</book></span></quote>
