Personal Belief
===============

It is difficult to rationally discuss topics where *personal* belief might be introduced into a conversation. The primary source of contention is always the psychological nature of the belief held by the individual. It is the degree with which the individual identifies with the belief that distinguishes it from being able to be discussed rationally or not. If we consider a *belief* to be a conclusion an individual has arrived at, then a *personal belief* could be considered the identification of one’s self with that conclusion. Any opposition that might be raised toward the personal belief of an individual is perceived not as an objection to the validity of the belief, but rather as an attack on the identity of the individual who holds it. Losing an argument for the validity of a personally held belief is tantamount to losing one’s own identity and can produce cognitive dissonance. In this way personal beliefs are held dogmatically even though they might not be promoted fanatically. The more reliant the individual’s identity is upon the belief, the more dogmatically they will hold to it. In this way, it becomes even harder for the individual to objectively analyze it as time goes on.

The two topics that are most notability ones where people have *personal beliefs* are politics and religion.

<quote><cite>“Political beliefs are like religious beliefs in the respect that both are part of who you are and important for the social circle to which you belong,” said lead author Jonas Kaplan, an assistant research professor of psychology at the Brain and Creativity Institute at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. “To consider an alternative view, you would have to consider an alternative version of yourself.”</cite><span>— <author>Gersema, Emily</author>, <book><a href='http://news.usc.edu/114481/which-brain-networks-respond-when-someone-sticks-to-a-belief/'>Which brain networks respond when someone sticks to a belief?</a></book></span></quote>

The fact that people *identify* themselves with a particular political party or religious sect is the exact reason why they aren’t able to objectively discuss either topic to various degrees. The stronger they view themselves as a member of a particular sect, the harder is it for them to see that alternative version of them-self. The psychological phenomenon that breeds this type of sectarian thinking is called groupthink.

These are some of the conclusions I’ve come to based on experience. I originally wrote it in 2014 and added additional information in 2016. Updated in 2017 with additional quote.
