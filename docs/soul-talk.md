### Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit

<quote><cite>It has generally been supposed that there are <i>two distinct kinds of substance</i> in human nature, and they have been distinguished by the terms <i>matter</i> and <i>spirit</i>. The former of these has been said to be possessed of the property of <i>extension</i>, viz. of length, breadth, and thickness, and also of <i>solidity</i> or <i>impenetrability</i>, but it is said to be naturally destitute of all powers whatever. The latter has of late been defined to be a substance entirely <i>destitute of all extension</i>, or <i>relation to space</i>, so as to have no propery in common with matter; and therefore to be properly <i>immaterial</i>, but to be possessed of the powers of <i>perception, intelligence, and self-motion</i>.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book><a href='http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit'>Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit</a> p. i-ii</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>It is likewise maintained in this treatise, that the notion of two substances that have no common property and yet are capable of <i>intimate connection</i> and <i>mutual action</i>, is both absurd and <i>modern</i>.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book><a href='http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit'>Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit</a> p. iii</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>I shall devote as much of my time as possible to the <i>pursuit of truth</i>, and as little as I can help to the mere <i>defense of it</i>, or of <i>myself</i>.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book><a href='http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit'>Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit</a> p. xix</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The reason of the conclusion above-mentioned, is simply this, that the powers of sensation or perception, and thought, as belonging to man, have never been found but in conjunction with a certain <i>organized system of matter</i>; and therefore, that those powers necessarily exist in, and depend upon, such a system.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book><a href='http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit'>Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit</a> p. 46</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Moreover, as the faculty of thinking in general ripens, and comes to maturity with the body, it is also observed to decay with it; and if, in some cases, the mental faculties continue vigorous when the body in general is enfeebled, it is evidently because, in those particular cases, the <i>brain</i> is not much affected by the general cause of weakness.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book><a href='http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit'>Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit</a> p. 47</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Likewise, as the mind is affected in consequence of the affections of the body and brain, so the body is liable to be reciprocally affected by the affections of the mind.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book><a href='http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit'>Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit</a> p. 48}</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Notwithstanding, Mr. Hallet was satisfied that there was no good argument from the light of nature, in favour either of the immateriality or immortality of the soul, he still retained the belief of it on the authority, as he imagined, of <i>revelation</i>. But it will be seen, in a subsequent section, that the scriptures afford no evidence whatever of a thing so contrary to the principles of reason; but that the sacred writers go upon quite different principles, always taking for granted the very thing I am here contending for; and that the notion of the soul being a substance distinct from the body, was originally a part of the system of <i>heathenism</i>, and was from thence introduced into christianity, which has derived the greatest part of its corruptions from this source.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book><a href='http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit'>Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit</a> p. 51}</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Thus, we might conclude, that the body was mortal, from observing that all the separate sense, and limbs, were liable to decay and perish.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book><a href='http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit'>Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit</a> p. 56}</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>That a spirit is, strictly speaking, <i>indivisible</i>, which is essential to the modern idea of it, is absolutely incompatible with the notion that is known to have run through almost all the systems of the ancients, derived originally from the East, viz. that all human souls, and all finite intelligences, were originally <i>portions of the great soul of the universe</i>; and though detached from it for a time, are finally to be absorbed into it again;</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book><a href='http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit'>Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit</a> p. 73</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Consequently, according to the strict and only consistent system of immateriality, a spirit is properly <i>no where</i>, and altogether incapable of <i>local motion</i>, though it has an arbitary connection with a body, that is confined to a particular place, and is capable of moving from one place to another.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book><a href='http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit'>Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit</a> p. 76</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>How unintelligibly are persons reduced to talk, when they quit the road of common sense, forming their systems not from <i>facts</i> and <i>appearances</i>, but from <i>imagination</i>.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book><a href='http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit'>Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit</a> p. 78</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The vulgar, who consider <i>spirit</i> as a <i>thin aerial substance</i>, would be exceedingly puzzled if they were to endeavour to realize the modern idea of a proper <i>immaterial being</i>; since, to them, it would seem to have nothing <i>positive</i> in its nature, but to be only a <i>negation of properties</i>, though disguised under the positive appellation of <i>spirit</i>. To them it must appear to be the idea of <i>nothing at all</i>, and to be incapable of supporting any properties.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book><a href='http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit'>Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit</a> p. 92</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The essence of the soul, it is said, cannot be matter, because it would then be divisible; but is not everything that is extended divisible?</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book><a href='http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit'>Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit</a> p. 95</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>How easy is it to get rid of the embarrassment attending the doctrine of the soul, in every view of it, by admitting, agreeably to all the phenomena, that the power of thinking belongs to the brain of a man, as that of walking to his feet, or that of speaking to his tongue; that, therefore, man, who is one being, is composed of <i>one kind of substance</i>, made of the <i>dust of the earth</i>; that when he dies, he of course, ceases to think; but when his <i>sleeping dust</i> shall be re-animated at the resurrection, his power of thinking, and his consciousness, will be restored to him?</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book><a href='http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit'>Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit</a> p. 102</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>There can be no state of mind to which there is no a corresponding state of the brain... unless &lsqb;of course&rsqb; the mind could have sensations and ideas independent of the state of the brain, which every observation proves to be impossible.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book><a href='http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit'>Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit</a> p. 120</book></span></quote>

### Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion

<quote><cite>That this doctrine of a resurrection is inconsistent with that of a soul, which survives the body, and retains all of its faculties, not only unimpaired, but improved, (for such is the original and proper doctrine on the subject) is obvious to the slightest consideration. For if such be the condition of the soul, when freed from the clog and obstruction of the body, a resurrection would not only be unnecessary, but even undesirable. The two systems are, therefore, repugnant to each other, and cannot be rationally held together.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book>Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion p. 212</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>He &lsqb;Plato&rsqb; moreover held that “the soul consists of three parts, the first the seat of intelligence, the second of the passions, and the third of appetite,” and he assigned to each its proper place in the human body.</cite><span>— <author>Priestley, Joseph</author>, <book>Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion p. 217</book></span></quote>

### Principles of nature

<quote><cite>The human mind is incapable of forming any conception of that which is not material; man is a being whose composition is purely physical, and moral properties or intellect, are the necessary results of organic construction</cite><span>— <author>Palmer, Elihu</author>, <book>Principles of nature Gb. 214-215</book></span></quote>

### World religions

<quote><cite>Traditional philosophy boasts of the vast differences in all aspects between animals and men. However, the more we study animals, the more we realize that the similarities between man and animals are far more striking than the differences.</cite><span>— <author>William, Xavier</author>, <book>World Religions KL 884-885</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The early concept of God was that of a ghostly spirit. For the Tennessee, a native tribe in the United States, the word for god, means literally a dead man. Similarly, the term ‘Jehovah’ originally meant the “strong man” or “the warrior.”</cite><span>— <author>William, Xavier</author>, <book>World Religions KL 994-996</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Newborns and infants, on the other hand, are not aware of their aspirations and fears and so cannot project these feelings on to others. Naturally, babies and infants are immune from being possessed or threatened by ghosts, spirits, demons or devils.</cite><span>— <author>William, Xavier</author>, <book>World Religions KL 1212-1213</book></span></quote>

### Wikipedia

<quote><cite>Plato (429–347 B.C.E.) argued that, as the body is from the material world, the soul is from the world of ideas and is thus immortal. He believed the soul was temporarily united with the body and would only be separated at death, when it would return to the world of Forms. Since the soul does not exist in time and space, as the body does, it can access universal truths.</cite><span>— <author>Wikipedia</author>, <book><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem'>Mind Body Problem</a></book></span></quote>

### The doctrine of inspiration

<quote><cite>Thus, the word “ghost” is by no means confined to the denoting a divine agent; but even, in modern English, it signifies the popular idea of any disembodied human person; and, in scriptural English, we find the expression “yielded up the ghost” as the rendering for a Greek word signifying “died :” and the word “spirit” is by us employed, in manifold senses, to denote courage, animation, alcoholic mixtures, and a multitude of other things.</cite><span>— <author>Macnaught, John</author>, <book>The doctrine of inspiration p. 141</book></span></quote>
