<quote><cite>No where do the scriptures explicitly say, “The bible is inerrant in all that it affirms”</cite><span>— <author>McDowell, Josh</author>, <book>New Evidence That Demands A Verdict p. 344</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>This book is said to be given by divine inspiration; but is it possible that inspiration can be either transferred, translated, altered, or revised? Certainly the very nature of the thing forbids it... If it were binding on the first persons who received it, it could not be equally so upon the second, for the nature and force of the communications were essentially destroyed. The first power that communicated was divine, the second was human; the first was incapable of error, the second deceptive and fellacious.</cite><span>— <author>Carlile, R</author>, <book>Principles of nature pp. 21-22</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>To render this system correct, it is not only necessary that the first prophets and apostles should have been inspired, but that all the translators, transcribers, printers, and printer's boys, should have been inspired too.</cite><span>— <author>Carlile, R</author>, <book>Principles of nature p. 22</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>If inspiration be a thing found in truth, there can be no occasion to alter or revise it. It is defect alone that creates the necessity of alteration and revision.</cite><span>— <author>Carlile, R</author>, <book>Principles of nature p. 22</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Therefore, if the Bible was right at first, every alteration is a deviation from that rectitude; and consequently, in proportion as the scriptures have been altered and revised in modern times, the Christian believer has been led astray; he has not believed in the real and true word of God.</cite><span>— <author>Carlile, R</author>, <book>Principles of nature p. 22</book></span></quote>
