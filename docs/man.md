### Human Brain

The human brain is similar to a hard drive in that it has a finite storage capacity. When a hard drive reaches capacity it becomes necessary to compress its contents or optimize the usage of disk space through defragmentation. In the same way, it is not physically possible to remember everything that happens throughout our lives. Our brains undergo a similar process of compressing and optimizing the details of our daily lives — most likely while we are sleeping.

The difference between the two optimization processes is that lossless operations are performed on our hard drives and lossly operations are performed by our brain. In other words, optimizations done on a hard drive preserve all data where as optimizations done by our brain preserve only relevant data. It is the data that is preserved in this process that is used by our brain to construct the stories or narratives it carries with it.

We carry with us all sorts of stories; which are compacted versions of events. And we use these stories to help us understand the world around us.

Problems arise when stories conflict with one another. Two individuals can experience the same event together and come away with different stories. And these stories can diverge further from each other as time passes. It is through societal pressures that one story becomes the officially accepted story. To question that story or to raise any doubts about it eventually becomes a hersey.

### Violent Thoughts

There is an episode of Star Trek Voyager where the crew visits a planet where they eventually find it is illegal to think violent thoughts. Unknowingly one crew member violates the law and is arrested by the authorities who charge her with the crime of _aggravated violent thought_. The basis for that law was the idea that _violent thoughts lead to violent actions_.

But violent thoughts do not always lead to violent actions. If it were the case, our maximum security prisons would be full of murder mystery and horror story writers. In fact, it is possible to think a thought and take no action toward it; many people think about getting into shape but few actually do it.

If we have a disturbing thought it does not necessarily mean we will act in a disturbing manner. The fact that we consider it a disturbing thought is evidence enough that our faculties are still in tact. We should not be afraid when we have stray thoughts for as quick as a thought comes it also goes.

<quote><cite>It is a contradiction in terms to assert that any man has a right to do wrong; the exercise of such a pretended right, is the absolute destruction of all right, and the first human being who commits violence, has already prepared for himself a hell of retailation, the justice of which, his own mind can never deny.</cite><span>— <author>Palmer, Elihu</author>, <book>Principles of nature Gb. 216</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Secondly, inasmuch as this power has given to every man the ability of preserving and maintaining his own existence, it clearly follows, that all men are constituted independent of each other, they are created free, that no man can be subject, and no man sovereign, but that all men are the unlimited proprietors of their own persons.</cite><span>— <author>Palmer, Elihu</author>, <book>Principles of nature Gb. 219</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Most of the greatest evils that man has inflicted upon man have come through people feeling quite certain about something which, in fact, was false.</cite><span>— <author>Russell, Bertrand</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The rule is that each increment of material possessions brings less joy than the one that immediately preceded it. If one could quantify job, it is likely that a new pair of shoes brings more happiness to a child than a new car brings to a grown man. Also, the first car brings more joy than the second, and the second more than the third. H. L. Mencken said, “A man always remembers his first love. After that he begins to bunch them.”</cite><span>— <author>Harris, Thomas</author>, <book>I'm OK - You're OK pg. 143</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>School, unless it has truly competent teachers, is the place where scholastically the “rich get richer and the poor get poorer.”</cite><span>— <author>Harris, Thomas</author>, <book>I'm OK - You're OK pg. 162</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>It has been said that blaming your faults on your nature does not change the nature of your faults. Thus, “I am like that” does not help anything. “I can be different” does.</cite><span>— <author>Harris, Thomas</author>, <book>I'm OK - You're OK pg. 114</book></span></quote>

### Marriage

<quote><cite>Different religious and cultural content can produce serious difficulties if each partner feels the strong need to abide by the unexamined dictates of his Parent. Sometimes this difference is glossed over in the early stage of a marriage, only to emerge with fierce urgency with the arrival of children.</cite><span>— <author>Harris, Thomas</author>, <book>I'm OK - You're OK pg. 134</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The average marriage contract is a bad one, a fifty-fifty deal with emphasis on the bookkeeping.</cite><span>— <author>Harris, Thomas</author>, <book>I'm OK - You're OK pg. 136</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Common relationship wreckers are absolute declarations of “That's the way I am - don't try to change me.” Holding to a rigid “I am a grouch before my first cup of coffee” blames a person's fault on his nature and not his nature on his faults. The “Grouch Before Coffee” racket ruins every morning in many families. What could be the best part of the day, a send-off with enthusiasm to the tasks ahead, is instead a miserable, hostile bedlam. The kids go off to school grumping, husband rushes off to work fumbling for his Tums, and mother feels let down because she just lost her captive audience. The fact is that no one has to be a grouch before his first cup of coffee or any other time. He has a choice..</cite><span>— <author>Harris, Thomas</author>, <book>I'm OK - You're OK pg. 138</book></span></quote>
