{{quote|Mention is made in the scriptures of ''angels'', as created beings, superior to man; but they are never supposed to interfere in the affairs of men, except on particular occasions, and by the express appointment of the Supreme Being, never by their own voluntary agency. They are employed merely as ''messengers'' (for so their name in the Hebrew signifies) to convey the orders of the Almighty. But according to the system of the philosophers, as well as that of the vulgar, among the heathens, they are beings inferior to the Supreme, who ''at their own pleasure'', interfere in the affairs of men, and act according to their own peculiar humours and passions.|Priestley, Joseph|Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion p. 197}}

{{quote|Though Democritus rejected the doctrine of a Supreme Deity, he admitted the popular belief of divinities [angels] inhabiting the aerial regions, saying that &quot;they made themselves visible to favoured mortals, and enabled them to foretel future events.|Priestley, Joseph|Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion p. 199}}</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15535">{{quote|This was the very definition of panic disorder, he explained - the fear of more panic attacks. They're so traumatic that the sufferer is terrified of experiencing more of them, and begins to avoid situations that may produce them.|Ryckert, Dan|Anxiety as an Ally p. 22}}

{{quote|Panic attacks and generalized anxiety are very difficult to explain to the portion of the population that has never struggled with these conditions.|Ryckert, Dan|Anxiety as an Ally p. 29}}

{{quote|The brain starts coming up with every worst case scenario that it can, but then there inevitably comes a point where it just... ends. It seems like the brain reaches some kind of threshold for anxiety that it can't support for long periods of time, and every panic attack reaches an end. Years later, I'd adopt &quot;It always ends&quot; as a kind of mantra.|Ryckert, Dan|Anxiety as an Ally p. 31}}

{{quote|Only in 1980 - after new drugs designed to treat anxiety had been developed and brought to market - were the anxiety disorders finally introduced into the third edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, displacing Freudian neurosis. In an important sense, the treatment predated the diagnosis - that is, the discovery of antianxiety drugs drove the creation of anxiety as a diagnostic category.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 10}}

{{quote|For instance, generalized worry about future events... tends to appear as hyperactivity in the front lobes of the cerebral cortex... most fearful emotions and behaviors are in one way or another produced by, or at least processed through, the amygdala...|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 11}}

{{quote|If we can't control something, there's no value in fearing it, since the fear accomplishes nothing.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 12}}

{{quote|The Stoic philosopher Epictetus anticipated the same idea about faulty cognitions. &quot;People are not disturbed by things but by the view they take of them,&quot; he wrote in the first century; for Epictetus, the roots of anxiety lay not in our biology but in how we apprehend reality. Alleviating anxiety is a matter of &quot;correcting erroneous perceptions&quot;.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety pp. 12-13}}

{{quote|Why do drug treatments for anxiety that work so well on Americans and the French seem not to work effectively on the Chinese.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 21}}

{{quote|All of which lends the appearance of scientific validity to the diagnosing of an anxiety disorder. But the reality is that there is a large quotient of subjectivity here (both on the part of patients, in describing their symptoms, and of clinicians, in interpreting them). Studies in the 1950s found that when two psychiatrists consulted the same patient, they gave the same DSM diagnosis only about 40 percent of the time.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 39}}

{{quote|Some geneticists say they can find no distinction between major depression and generalized anxiety disorder.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 39}}

{{quote|The result of a physiological fear response that has no legitimate object, or that is disproportionate to the size of the threat, can be pathological anxiety - an evolutionary impulse gone awry. William James, the psychologist and philosopher, surmised that the cause of severe anxiety, and of what we would today call panic attacks, might be modernity itself - specifically, the fact that our primitive fight-or-flight responses are not suited to modern civilization. &quot;The progress from brute to man is characterized by nothing so much as by the decrease in frequency of proper occasions for fear,&quot; James observed in 1884. &quot;In civilized life, in particular, it has at last become possible for large numbers of people to pass from the cradle to the grave without ever having a pang of genuine fear.&quot;|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety pp. 44-45}}

{{quote|Many studies are now finding that cognitive-behavioral therapy, or CBT, is the safest most effective treatment for many forms of depression and anxiety disorders.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 52}}

{{quote|Which means that anxiety, for all the philosophizing and psychologizing we've attached to it, may be an irreducibly biological phenomenon that is not so different in humans than in animals.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 55}}

{{quote|David Barlow, the former head of the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders, says the goal of exposure therapy is to &quot;scare the hell out of the patient&quot; in order to teach him that he can handle the fear.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 69}}

{{quote|Writing an emotionally neutral account is a commonly prescribed way of trying to forestall post-traumatic stress disorder after a traumatic experience.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety pp. 71-72}}

{{quote|This is consistent with a trait called anxiety sensitivity, which research has shown to be strongly correlated with panic disorder. Individuals who rate high on the so-called Anxiety Sensitivity Index, or ASI, have a high degree of what's known as interoceptive awareness, to the beepings and bleatings, the blips and burps, of their physiologies; they are more conscious of their heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, breathing rates, digestive burblings, and so forth than other people are. This hyperawareness of physiological activity makes such people more prone to &quot;internally cued panic attacks&quot;: the individual with a high ASI rating picks up on a subtle increase in heart rate or a slight sensation of dizziness or a vague, unidentifiable fluttering in the chest; this perception, in turn, produces a frisson of conscious anxiety, which causes those physical sensations to intensify.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 76}}

{{quote|Social phobics worry that their interpersonal awkardness or the physical manifestations of anxiety - their blushing and shaking and sweating - will somehow reveal them to be weak or incompetent.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 102}}

{{quote|The social phobic (timide) fears other people, lacks self-confidence, and eschews social interactions.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 104}}

{{quote|A cross-cultural comparison conducted in 1994 suggested that the relative prevalence of social phobia symptoms in Japan could be related to &quot;the socially promoted show of shame among Japanese people.&quot; Japanese society itself, the lead researcher of the survey argued, could be considered &quot;pseudo-sociophobic&quot; because feelings and behaviors that in the West would be considered psychiatric symptoms - excessive shame, avoidance of eye contact, elaborate displays of deference - are cultural norms in Japan. If nothing else, this demonstrates the complex ways in which culture and medicine interact: what's normal, even valorized, in one culture is considered pathological in another.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 104}}

{{quote|Besides, some quotient of nervousness about social interactions is normal. How many of us don't feel some discomfort at the prospect of having to make small talk with strangers at a party? Who doesn't feel some measure of anxiety at having to perform in public or to be judged by an audience? Such anxiety is healthy, even adaptive.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 106}}

{{quote|Many studies have demonstrated that the amygdalae of those diagnosed with social anxiety disorder tend to be consistently more reactive to the human gaze than those of healthy control subjects.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 108}}

{{quote|Two influential twentieth-century psychotherapists, Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck, the founders of rational emotive behavioral therapy (REBT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) respectively, each argued that the treatment of social anxiety boils down to overcoming fear of disapproval. To overcome social anxiety, they say, you need to inure yourself to needless shame.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 111}}

{{quote|That is, social phobics are better at picking up on subtle social cues than other people are - but they tend to over-interpret anything that could be construed as a negative reaction. Since they are predisposed to believe that people won't like them or will react badly to them (they tend to have obessive thoughts like ''I'm boring'' or ''I'm going to make a fool of myself by saying something stupid''), they're always seeking confirmation of this belief by interpreting...|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 113}}

{{quote|This finding aligns with the many studies showing that social phobics demonstrate a more hyperreactive amygdala response to negative facial expressions.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 115}}

{{quote|Like low-ranking animals, people with the general subtype of social anxiety disorder tend to look downward, avoid eye contact, blush, and engage in behaviors that advertise their submissiveness, eagerly seeking to please their peers and superiors and actively deferring to others to avoid conflict.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 119}}

{{quote|Low-status monkeys and socially phobic humans also tend to have notable irregularities in the processing of certain neurotransmitters. Studies have found that monkeys with enhanced serotonergic function (in essence, higher levels of serotonin in their brain synapses) tend to be more dominant, more friendly, and more likely than those with normal serotonin levels to bond with their peers. In contrast, monkeys with unusually low serotonin levels are more likely to display avoidant behavior: they keep to themselves and avoid social interactions.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 119}}

{{quote|The association of dopamine and serotonin with social phobia doesn't prove that neurotransmitter deficits ''cause'' social anxiety - those irregularities could be the ''effects'' of social anxiety, the neurochemical &quot;scars&quot; that develop when the brain becomes overstressed from having to be so vigilant all the time, constantly scanning the environment for social threats.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 120}}

{{quote|Thinking ''too much'' about what you are doing actually impairs performance.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 131}}

{{quote|Anxiety can spread by contagion, so armies seek aggressively to contain it.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 134}}

{{quote|Everyone of the most commerical significant classes of antianxiety and antidepressant drugs of the last sixty years was discovered by accident or was originally developed for something completely unrelated to anxiety or depression: to treat tuberculosis, surgical shock, allergies; to use as an insecticide, a penicillin preservative, an industrial dye, a disinfectant, rocket fuel.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 155}}

{{quote|But a hundred years from now, medical historians may once again be marveling at the addictive, toxic, or useless substances we consume in such great quantities.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 157}}

{{quote|This was the moment the pharmaceutical industry awoke to the idea that it could sell psychiatric drugs by marketing them as correcting &quot;chemical imbalances,&quot; or deficiencies of certain neurotransmitters.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 175}}

{{quote|The Greeks also credited Pan with their victory at the Battle of Marathon in 490 B.C., where he was said to have put anxiety in the hearts of the enemy Persians. The experience of sudden terror - especially in crowded places - became known as ''pan''ic (from the Greek panikos, literally &quot;of Pan&quot;)|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 182}}

{{quote|Panic disorder was the first psychiartic disease for which the determining factor in its creation was a drug reaction: imipramine cures panic; ipso facto panic disorder must exist. But this phenomenon - in which a drug effectively defined the syndrome for which it was described - would soon recur.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 187}}

{{quote|For starters, some of its [the DSM's] new category distinctions appear awfully arbitrary. (Why does panic disorder require the presence of four symptoms, rather than three or five, from the list of thirteen? Why do symptoms have to persist for six months, and not five or seven, for an official diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. The head of the DSM-III task force, Robert Spitzer, would concede years later that many of its decisions were made haphazardly.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 191}}

{{quote|Studies have shown that people who score high on scales of anxiety sensitivity tend to suffer drug side effects more severely.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 206}}

{{quote|We may look back 150 years from now and see antidepressants as a dangerous and sinister experiment.|Glenmullen, Joseph|Prozac Blacklash}}

{{quote|The serotonin theory of depression is comparable to the masturbatory theory of insanity.|Healy, David}}

{{quote|One early study of a group of depressed patients, reported in Science in 1976, found that only half had atypical levels of serotonin - and only half of those had serotonin levels that were lower than average, meaning that only a quarter of the depressed patients could be considered serotonin deficient. In fact, an equally large number had serotonin levels that were higher than average. Many subsequent studies have produced results that complicate the notion of a consistent relationship between serotonin deficiency and mental illness.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety pp. 217-218}}

{{quote|Edward Drummond, a psychiatrist in New England, used to regularly prescribe benzodiazepine tranquilizers o his patients in order to reduce their anxiety. Today, he strongly believes tranquilizers are a significant cause of chronic anxiety. Taking Xanax or Ativan can temporarily alleviate acute anxiety, Drummond says, but at the cost of allowing us to avoid dealing with whatever issues are causing that anxiety.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 222}}

{{quote|According to the stress-diathesis model of mental illness, clinical disorders like anxiety and depression often erupt when a genetic susceptibility to psychiatric disease combines with life stressors that overwhelm the individual's ability to cope.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 286}}

{{quote|&quot;There is no greater cause of melancholy than idleness, 'no better cure than business,'&quot; he wrote, citing the Arbian physician Rhasis.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 309}}

{{quote|The experience of trauma or abuse, he explained, gets stored in the body, &quot;woven into the bodily tissue.&quot;|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 319}}

{{quote|Anxiety is productive mainly when it is not so excessive as to be debilitating.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 325}}

{{quote|Anxious people, because they are vigilantly scanning the environment for threats, tend to be more attuned than adrenaline junkies to other people's emotions and social signals.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 325}}

{{quote|Albert Bandura believed that repeatedly proving to oneself one's competence and ability to master situations, and doing so in spite of feelings of anxiety, depression, or vulnerability, builds up self-confidence and psychological strength that can provide a bulwark against anxiety and depression.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 336}}

{{quote|I have come to believe that anxiety accompanies intellectual activity as its shadow and that the more we know of the nature of anxiety, the more we will know of intellect.|Liddel, Howard|The role of vigilance in the development of animal neurosis}}</text>

===The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance===

{{quote|It is “the ingrafted word which is able to save” the soul, James 1:21. Christ sanctifies and cleanses the church “with the washing of water by the word,” Eph v. 26. This “ingrafted word,” this sanctifying “washing of water by the word” is all inward and spiritual. It is the antitype of the divers washings under Moses, and equally so of water baptism, in every form. This cleanses the soul, as outward water does the body, and puts away the filth of the spirit, as that does the filth of the flesh.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 7-8}}

{{quote|He did not breathe on his disciples, and baptize them with the Holy Ghost, to qualify them to baptize others in water.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 12}}

{{quote|John had, as he baptized the people, diligently preached the kingdom at hand, not yet fully come, and taught them to look beyond his outward, to Christ’s inward and saving baptism.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 16}}

{{quote|The Father Almighty, in his unlimited goodness, and good will to men, took special care that John, the preparer of his way, in the power and spirit of Elias, should be expressly sent before him, baptizing in water, as a lively resemblance and representation of his great work, in thoroughly cleansing the floor of the heart.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 21}}

{{quote|And hence I think it generally holds good, that those who are very tenacious of them, most zealous in their use, urge them the most pressingly on others, and most liberally censure and condemn those, who, believing them to be no gospel ordinances, conscientiously decline them; are less livingly sensible of the life and substance.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 25}}

{{quote|Paul told the Galatians, “if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing,” Gal v. 2. This must amount of thus much at least, that in proportion as they relied on, or were taken up with attention to that outward performance, they were diverted from Christ – and this is just as true of water baptism, and every other outward symbol.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 27}}

{{quote|And I am sorry to perceive such numbers of professing Christians striving so hard, as I think they do, to make these things serve as a substitute for that which is saving. They evidently substitute water baptism instead of Christ’s; for they do not scruple to call it the one baptism of the gospel. They expressly maintain it to be Christ’s, and apply it to many texts which evidently speak of far deeper matters; as baptism into Christ, into his death, &amp;c. and that which speaks of the baptism which now saves us, although the text itself declares it is not the putting away of the filth of the flesh (the proper work of water) yet they insist it is water; and so make it out, if they substantially make out any thing by it, that a figure saves us.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 27-28}}

{{quote|Having seen that Christ’s baptism in the figure could only be suffered; seeing the figures precede, point to, but belong not to the gospel, and that now, before the figurative dispensation was abolished, was the only proper and acceptable time for it.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 30}}

{{quote|Paul says, “circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing,” 1 Cor. Vii. 19; and it holds equally in outward baptism, and the supper – If one shadow were any thing in the gospel, another might as well be something – Circumcision would be as much something as baptism – The gospel excludes them all.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 33}}

{{quote|What can all the shadows, of the good things to come, do for those who possess and enjoy the good things themselves.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 51}} 

{{quote|For this baptism was now so evidently dispensed through Peter’s preaching , that he immediately remembered this precious promise of our blessed Lord – which had been very illy applied by him to the Holy Ghost falling on them|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 54}} 

{{quote|Indeed the very query, “can any man forbid water?” &amp;c. Acts 10:47, is an appeal to men, and bespeaks a state of hesitation, or uncertainty.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 55}} 

{{quote|we do not read, that, &quot;finding fault&quot;, with the rites, figures and ordinances of the first covenant, God ordained water-washing, and eating and drinking bread and wine, as more permanent and perpetual institutions of the new or second covenant - Nay, verily, he finds fault equally with all things in their own nature equally partaking of the same weakness|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 78-79}}  

{{quote|Why then continue a baptism that was expressly unto repentance, for the remission of sins, if we have obtained remission?|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 81}}

{{quote|We read expressly, that he directed one to go and offer for his cleansing &quot;the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them,&quot; Mat. viii. 4. Another he ordered to &quot;go wash in the pool of Siloam,&quot; John ix. 7: but not an instance of any one ordered by him to be baptized by another in water. But had water baptism been his, or any part of his gospel, it would have been a strange thing indeed had he never vouchsafed once to administer it, nor order it done on any of the multitudes that believed on him, or out of whom he cast devils, or whom he healed.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 95}}

{{quote|Nor did Christ, when he came, ever once, that we read of, call that of water his baptism.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 97}}

{{quote|And yet this sensible author will not allow any thing at all in it, or to be understood, or even implied in it, but what Christ fully and plainly declared his mind about: and then queries, &quot;where has Jesus Christ declared his mind, and declared it fully and plainly, that infants are to receive Christian baptism?&quot; Now, serious reader, let us just vary the terms of this question, and ask, &quot;where has Jesus Christ declared his mind fully and plainly - nay, where has he declared it at all, that adults are to be baptized in water? or where has he ever declared material water to be his baptism?&quot; I believe the text where he has declared this is not in the Bible, any more tan the other.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 108}}

{{quote|But he goes on, and asks, &quot;is not our Savior's commission far from declaring fully and plainly in favour of children's baptism, perfectly silent on this head?&quot; And I ask, is it not as perfectly silent about water?|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 108-109}}

{{quote|But prejudice has such a powerful influence, that many texts are read and quoted in support of elementary water, which speak only of the spiritual water of the word.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 111}}

{{quote|Now there is but &quot;one Lord, one faith, and one baptism,&quot; belonging to the Christian dispensation -- but here this author, three times, mentions expressly both the baptism of the Spirit, or Holy Ghost, and the baptism of water, as distinct things, as two baptisms, and urges them, being both used in the case of Cornelius, as proof that water baptism belongs to the gospel -- Will he say, Christ instituted two baptisms? If not, as here where two are mentioned, it is plain one only of them was Christ's. If Christ's is but one and that one be not Christ's, but, as the Quaker says, was John's. On the other hand, if Christ's is but one, and the one be immersions in elementary water, then that of the Holy Ghost is not Christ's -- So that this instance, instead of proving water baptism to be Christ's proves quite the contrary.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 114-115}}

{{quote|Ananias was sent to Paul expressly, Acts 9:17, that he might &quot;be filled with the Holy Ghost.&quot; Then surely he instrumentally dispensed or ministered it to him, or (which is the same thing) baptized him with it.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 122}}

{{quote|Some contend against baptizing spiritually by teaching in the power of the gospel, and urge that the gift of tongues always attended baptism of the Holy ghost. If so, who have this baptism in our day? Will it be granted that none are now baptized with the baptism of Christ?|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 122-123}}

{{quote|Is water baptism once called Christ's in all the Bible? Is it once called a gospel ordinance? Did Christ ever practice it? Was John's baptism Christ's? If not, were Christ's twelve disciples ever baptized with Christ's baptism, or not? If Christ's is water, and yet not the same of john's, who baptized these Apostles, seeing Jesus baptized none in water?|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 135}}

{{quote|If Christ had ordained water baptism, he would have administered it to those he sent to administer it to others. And I rest firmly persuaded he never did ordain it, but that all the water baptism now practiced among Christians is derived from John, or else is altogether, unauthorized in the New Testament. And why do those who now use it, use a form of words never once used by any of the Apostles? If they say Christ commanded it, then why did not his Apostles obey his command?|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 138}}

{{quote|It is urged by some, that putting on Christ, which all do who are baptized into him, Gal iii. 27, is giving up their names to Christ in water baptism: but of those baptized into Christ, in the Apostle's sense, he here declares, &quot;ye are all in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ's then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise,&quot; 28, 29; that is real heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ. This certainly is not true of as many as are baptized into water, though it certainly is true of as may as are baptized into Christ.

{{quote|At any rate, and turn it every way, will not the result be, either that Paul did not mean as he said, that they really were baptized, but only that their passage resembled baptism, and may bear an allusion to it, or that he meant an outward baptism, without either dipping or sprinkling, or that he meant an inward and spiritual baptism?|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 146}}

{{quote|Thus men by attachment to rituals, are liable to have their minds veiled, from beholding the obviously inward and spiritual meaning of scripture, or at least turned to seek or suppose an outward signification, where none seems necessary or intended, but that which centers in the life and substance.|Scott, Job|The baptism of Christ a gospel ordinance p. 166}}

{{quote|The time for administering water-baptism was then present; the time for administering spiritual baptism was then future.|MacNair, Robert|Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 18}}

{{quote|How is it that with all the pains they have been at to tell us water-baptism is not the only baptism, we still understand them by the simple word baptize to refer to water-baptism? For this reason, that they are speaking of baptism as an existing fact, and their own narratives teach us that of the two kinds they had mentioned, water-baptism was the only one which then had a being. Till the time when the Spirit is given, they are safe in using the word baptism, even without an adjunct, as equivalent to water-baptism.|MacNair, Robert|Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 19-20}}

{{quote|Now, if we read the passage in the text in like manner, it will be, the prophets and the law prophesied until John, he being the last prophet under the old economy, not the first of a new.|MacNair, Robert|Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 27}}

{{quote|When asked why he [John] baptized though he was not the Christ, his justification he bases upon this, “I baptize with water.”|MacNair, Robert|Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 37}}

{{quote|John’s baptism must include both of these characters, and might therefore be expressed thus, a baptism with water, in which the subject is called upon to exercise repentance.|MacNair, Robert|Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 37}}

{{quote|We find in the use of language, that words often acquire secondary meanings, in which all trace of the original idea is lost sight of. Supposing that the word baptism meant originally cleansing, but that this cleansing was ordinarily effected by immersion, it would not be unparalleled to have a new application of the word, in which the idea of cleansing was dropped, and only that of immersion appeared.|MacNair, Robert|Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 40}}

{{quote|The experiment of ritual worship has been tried on a large scale. It answered the purpose for which it was established, but it has failed to effect a radical change in human nature… “For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did”… God has offered man a spiritual religion. But he longs for a ritual.|MacNair, Robert|Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 49}}

{{quote|But the very same circumstances which have rendered the sign of sacrifice obsolete render every other sign of a similar texture inappropriate. The sign of sacrifice was a testimony to the fact of an atonement not yet effected. The sign was a witness that the thing signified was yet future, and loses its meaning when this becomes present.|MacNair, Robert|Christian Baptism spiritual, not ritual p. 54}}

===An History of Corruption on Christianity===

{{quote|It was natural therefore, for the apostles, and other Jews, on the institution of baptism, to apply it to infants, as well as to adults, as a token of the profession of christianity by the master of the family only; and this they would do without considering it as a substitute for circumcision, and succeeding in the place of it, which it is never said to do in the scriptures, though some have been led by some circumstances of resemblance in the two rites to imagine this was the case.|Priestley, Joseph|An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 71}}

{{quote|There is this difference with respect to the corruptions of the rite of baptism, and those of the Lord's supper, that though they both began about the same time, and those relating to baptism were perhaps the earlier of the two, and the progress of superstition in consequence of this corruption, was rather more rapid in the first century of christianity, it was by no means so afterwards.|Priestley, Joseph|An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 79}}

{{quote|Wycliffe thought baptism to be necessary to salavation. &quot;The priest,&quot; he says, &quot;in baptism administers only the token or sign, but God, who is the priest and bishop of our souls, administers the spiritual grace.&quot; And Luther not only retained the rite of baptism, but even the ceremony of exorcism.|Priestley, Joseph|An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 91}}

{{quote|Those of the early Fathers who ascribed the least to the rite of baptism, supposed that by it was done away whatever inconvenience mankind had been subjected to in consequence of the fall of Adam; so that they made a great difference between the case of those children who died baptized, and those who died unbaptized|Priestley, Joseph|An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 200}}

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;No, men desire others to make a fair shew in the flesh constraining them to be water baptized that they might glory in their flesh.

Galatians 6:12-13 KJV - As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. 13 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.

Yes, the Galatians were being constrained to be circumcised just as today men constrain others to be water baptized. The why it is the same~that they may glory in your flesh.&lt;/poem&gt;

Galatians 3:27-28 KJV For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

Neither male nor female? I don't see anyone coming up out of the water neither male nor female. It is a baptism (identification) into Christ's death (Romans 6), baptized into Christ. It is BY one Spirit into one body. It cannot be accomplished by water.

You cannot just put water in everytime you see the word baptism. There is more than one baptism in the Bible too.&lt;/poem&gt;

{{quote|The ordinances of purification in the Levitical law relate especially to the removal of legal uncleanness connected with childbirth, death, and other pollutions. Washing was prescribed for such purposes, and also sprinkling with water of separation, water mingled with the ashes of the red heifer. Ablution formed part of the consecration of priests and without it they might not serve at the altar nor enter the tabernacle. In later times of Jewish national history, perhaps through the intercourse with nations whose lustrations entered more into the daily routine of life, ceremonial washings were multiplied.|Tylor, Edward B|Primitive culture p. 440}}

{{quote|Can water, externally applied, destroy internal moral turpitude? If human vices could be cured through this channel, the more rational efforts for the renovation and improvement of our character would become unnecessary. But it is clearly discernable, that as vice is a violation of moral law, the way to remedy the mischiefs resulting from this violation, is not to pour water on the face, which can have no possible influence on the mind, but to return to uniform conduct, consistent with the primary principles of moral virtue.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 45}}

{{quote|Regarding 1 Peter 3:21, the notes in the The Hebrew-Greek Key Study Bible (pages 1539-1540) explains, “The expression ‘baptism doth now save’ should be understood in light of verse twenty: ‘eight souls were saved by water.’ KJV’s “by water” is incorrect; the Greek is “through water (di udatos)” per (NKJV, NIV, NASB, Green’s Literal Translation, NRSV).|Faith Facts|[http://www.faithfacts.org/world-religions-and-theology/101-reasons-baptism-not-necessary-for-salvation 101 Reasons Why Water Baptism is Not Necessary to be Saved]}}

{{quote|Acts 22:16 says, “Now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.” According to the John MacArthur study Bible, “Grammatically the phrase, ‘calling on His name,’ precedes ‘Get up and be baptized.’ Salvation comes from calling on the name of the Lord (Romans 10:9, 10, 13), not from being baptized.”|Faith Facts|[http://www.faithfacts.org/world-religions-and-theology/101-reasons-baptism-not-necessary-for-salvation 101 Reasons Why Water Baptism is Not Necessary to be Saved]}}

{{quote|66. The Holy Spirit is the seal of the believer’s salvation (Eph. 4:30; 2 Cor. 1:22; Rom. 8:9), not water baptism.  Indeed, we are sealed by the Holy Spirit when we believed (Eph 1:11-14), and even before at the foundation of the world (Eph 1:3-12).|Faith Facts|[http://www.faithfacts.org/world-religions-and-theology/101-reasons-baptism-not-necessary-for-salvation 101 Reasons Why Water Baptism is Not Necessary to be Saved]}}

{{quote|101. And finally, for the record, the word baptism does not necessarily always mean immersion. For example, in 1 Corinthians 10:1-4 the Israelites were baptized by only getting their feet wet, while it was the Egyptians who got immersed. Luke 11:38 is a reference to the washing of hands, not of total body immersion. In Mark 7:4 baptism is described as washing of vessels, which is not necessarily immersion but could be pouring or scrubbing. Hebrews 9:10 speaks of “various ceremonial washings.” The word here is baptismos. The ceremonial washing, or baptisms, that follow are rites of purification in the Old Testament (cf. Heb 9:13-31). In all of these ceremonial washings, the method of application was sprinkling. In fact, all Old Testament purifications or washings were by sprinkling (Numbers 8:7, 19:19, Lev 14:7, etc).|Faith Facts|[http://www.faithfacts.org/world-religions-and-theology/101-reasons-baptism-not-necessary-for-salvation 101 Reasons Why Water Baptism is Not Necessary to be Saved]}}

{{quote|Some proponents of baptism for salvation at this point will assert that the means of appropriating salvation are different before and after the cross to try and discount these examples of Christ. There is no scriptural evidence at all that the means of appropriating salvation changed after the death and resurrection of Christ. In fact, scripture strongly concludes that the mode of salvation has always been through faith.|Shimer, Ted|[http://www.stumo.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Why-Baptism-is-Not-Necessary-for-Salvation.pdf Why Baptism is not Necessary for Salvation]}}

{{quote|Terms like divinity, Holy Ghost, Eucharist, prophet, omnipotence, infallibility etc are words for words’ sake and terms for terms’ sake. If we deliberate deeply on these permutation-combinations of high-sounding sounds and syllables and mean nothing verifiable. Take one of the most inspiring quotes from the Bible “I am the way, the truth and the life”, an astounding statement, which does not give away anything concrete. What is the exact meaning of the terms “way,”“truth” and “life”. Ask ten people the meaning of these fancy words and you will get twenty different answers.|William, Xavier|World Religions KL 7731-7735}}

{{quote|Most if not all verses in any of the scriptures can be interpreted in many ways. One of the more concrete sentences in the Bible is “He took bread in his hands…this is my body…etc” There is no controversy as to the meaning of “He took bread and raised it”. However, when it comes to the statement “This is my body”…“this is my blood” there is confusion. The numerous interpretations of these simple-looking sentences have been the cause of the most number of schisms in Christianity.|William, Xavier|World Religions KL 7745-7748}}

{{quote|Pontius Pilate has been much maligned for condemning Jesus to death. Nevertheless, from the circumstances described in the Gospels, we have to conclude he was a good administrator and a philosopher. He tried his best to save Jesus, even offering Barabas in exchange for Jesus. However, the Jews and their high priests would have none of it, and as an administrator, Pilate had his limitations. In the course of the trial, he discourses with Jesus only as a philosopher can. Jesus grows exuberant and talks of his father in heaven and his being sent by Him, which was gibberish to a foreigner like Pilate. Jesus also speaks frequently of the word, we discussed above—truth. Pilate fells Jesus with one simple question “What is truth?” Christian theologians maintain that Jesus did not answer the question due to its banality. I for one think it was the most intelligent thing that happened at the trial. Jesus was astounded by the import of the question. Even with a gifted tongue, Jesus was taken aback and tongue-tied by the question and its enormity.|William, Xavier|World Religions KL 7798-7805}}

{{quote|But, in the meanwhile, if we seek for a logical answer to our question, it will not be found in Holy Writ, at least not in the form of a definition; for the Bible is written throughout in popular, familiar phraseology, and not in the way of any philosophical system. One may find many rich and imaginative descriptions in the Bible but not a single logical or scientific definition.|Macnaught, John|The doctrine of inspiration p. 14}}

{{quote|We know that there are modes of ''explaining away'' these and all other discrepancies; but we feel that they are so thoroughly unsatisfactory - not to use a stronger word - that, though they may serve as a hiding-place for the doubts of those whose conclusions.. are foregone, yet they are a terrible stumbling-block to those who bring earnest, unprejudiced minds to the examination of Scripture.|Macnaught, John|The doctrine of inspiration p. 27}}

{{quote|Nor is it only in this case that such discrepancies manifest themselves to the careful observer. In almost every instance where two or more evangelists record the same conversation, the various interlocutors are represented as saying the exact words written; and yet the several accounts of their words differ remarkably.|Macnaught, John|The doctrine of inspiration p. 38}}

{{quote|At the outset, it is clear that a writing which records the narratives of miraculous events is not thereby proved to infallible. Those chronicles, for instance, which tell us of Dunstan's superhuman doings and sufferings, are not by any man supposed to be free from all admixture of error because they contain marvellous stories. Such chronicles may, indeed, be infallible; but, even to establish their credibility, they require all the more testimony, because they expect us to believe what is so unlike all that we have experienced.|Macnaught, John|The doctrine of inspiration p. 72}}

{{quote|From these considerations it is clear that no weight can logically attach to the complicated argument, in favour of scriptural infallibility, which is drawn from the authority calimed for Scripture by the New Testament writers. It is as futile as if one should say ''all'' the Pope's utterances must be infallible, because ''he himself claims'' infallibility as attaching to ''some'' of his sentences.|Macnaught, John|The doctrine of inspiration p. 79}}

{{quote|It may be interesting, however, to some of our readers to know, that the learned are by no means agreed that the term &quot;Word of God,&quot; is ever once used in Scripture as a designation of the Bible.|Macnaught, John|The doctrine of inspiration p. 89}}

{{quote|The variations and discrepancies which occur in the accounts of what was said by Jesus, or those around him, lead us to the supposition that human tradition, and not Divine dictation, was the source from which the evangelists, at all events, draw their information.|Macnaught, John|The doctrine of inspiration p. 93}}

{{quote|Thus, then, we conclude that these two Evangelists, and, like them, all the other New Testament writers, never dreamt of infallibility attaching to their books - never dreamt of the Spirit of God dictating their sentences; but knew well, as one of them has said, that they carefully and honestly obtained the best information they could, and then piously employed the knowledge they had acquired.|Macnaught, John|The doctrine of inspiration p. 95}}

{{quote|If one be asked, Why do you believe that woman was made out of man's rib? the answer is, Because the Bible, or the book of books, the greatest of all books, which is my rule (canon) of faith, tells me so. How constantly do men assume that such and such a statement cannot be erroneous, because it rests on the authority of the Bible!|Macnought, John|The doctrine inspiration p. 103}}

{{quote|And we have perhaps seen enough to show us that the broad distinction between canonical and uncanonical writings is one set up by the dogmatic definitions of man rather than by the actual differences which sever the two classes of composition.|Macnought, John|The doctrine inspiration p. 111}}

{{quote|If then all the promises of Jesus did not make Peter infallible as a religious teacher on that occasion at Antioch, what proof is there that they ''ever'' made him infallible either when he wrote or when he spoke?|Macnought, John|The doctrine inspiration p. 121}}

{{quote|Once let our minds be possessed with the notion that the book, which as containing the heavenly Father's teaching we rightly call the &quot;Word of God,&quot; was indited by the Holy Ghost and that its human authors were merely used by that Divine person as so many pens might be used by us - that these human authors were instruments in the hands of the Spirit and not rational free agents - and it follows by an easy process of logic, if not by a necessary course of piety, that we should believe there can be no error in that which the all-knowing has penned. But is not this to lose sight of the palpable fact that the inspired writers so completely retrained their human faculties that each wrote in his own style and according to the propensity or habit of his own disposition.|Macnought, John|The doctrine inspiration p. 127}}

{{quote|If blemishes in the creature be not incompatible with the stupendous interference of a Divine agency in generation, why should errors in the Bible be any more incompatible with the admirable co-operation of the Divine Spirit in the writing of the Bible?|Macnought, John|The doctrine inspiration pp. 128-129}}

{{quote|Or, again, Scripture itself teaches us that our bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost; and that, if any man love Jesus and keep his commandments, the Father and the Son will come and make their adobe with that man; and, yet, where is the man, except our Lord, who has been either impeccable or infallible?|Macnought, John|The doctrine inspiration p. 129}}

{{quote|Does the acknowledgment of the infallibility of this one standard bind in one brotherhood of agreement Episcopalians and Presbyterians, Calvinists and Arminians, and all other sects even of Protestantism? Has not each sect, and almost every individual, its own (fallible) interpretation of the infallible Book?|Macnought, John|The doctrine inspiration p. 133}}

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;In Genesis 6:4, the phrase “men of renown” uses the Hebrew word iysh. This term is used consistently as “man” or descendants of Adam—even Adam used it of himself in Genesis 2:23, yet it is never used of fallen angel, demons, or of Satan. It was used for some unfallen angels when they took the form of a man, though.

''Never once have I found a verse in the Bible where wife, wives, husband, husbands, or marriage was anything other than between a human male and female''. If these were marriages between fallen angels and women, then it opens up the possibility of marriages that are not limited to man and woman, when the Bible is clear on this subject.

Like the Sethite view, godly men (sons of God) were marrying women who were not godly (daughters of men), such as Cain’s (or others of Adam’s) descendants, including ungodly people from Seth’s line, thus resulting in Nephilim because they fell away from God’s favor. Once again, the Hebrew word Nephilim is related to the verb series “to fall.” For example, we know Cain fell away, and Lamech (descendant of Cain) and many other men and women had fallen away. ''The Nephilim could easily have been people who had fallen or turned from God in a severe way''. This would also make sense as to why some of Canaan’s descendants (descendants of Anak were Canaanites) were called Nephilim in Numbers 13.

If you recall, Sodom and Gomorrah were so sinful that they were destroyed with direct intervention by God (Genesis 18:20, 19:24). This reminds me of the Flood—God Himself had a direct hand in destroying them (Genesis 6:13, 17). When Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed, it is logical to assume that many descendants of those people who were not living in the area any longer were not destroyed. In fact, the Bible doesn’t say that all of the descendants of these places were completely destroyed. Therefore, it is logical that there could have been descendants living out away from the plain, such as Hebron, which is where the Anakites came from (Joshua 15:13).

The Bible indicates that the Anakites were descendants of the Nephilim, but it couldn’t have been those wiped out in the Flood, since God destroyed all land flesh. Therefore, it had to be group a people that were post-Flood. If the Nephilim had fallen so far pre-Flood that God Himself destroyed the earth as a result of their sin, then it makes sense that the post-Flood account of similar but smaller scale destruction in Sodom and Gomorrah may well have been the Nephilim. With the Anakites, who were Canaanites like those in Sodom and Gomorrah, they may very well have been their descendants.

It makes more sense that they were relatives/descendants from Sodom and Gomorrah (and the other cities of the plain). The sinners who died in the Flood and the sinners in Sodom and Gomorrah had one significant thing in common—they were the ones in history to fall so far from God that God Himself had a direct hand in destroying them. So, it makes sense why these two groups could both be called Nephilim in this view: 100% human descendants of Adam who were in a state of being fallen far from God. Of course, there should be no dogmatism about this point.&lt;/poem&gt;

{{quote|A present Evil is to be endured for the avoiding of a probable future Evil, which is far greater.|Wilkins, John|Of the principles and duties of natural religion p. 13}}

{{quote|''Doubt'' is a kind of ''Fear'', and is commonly styled ''formido oppositi''; and 'tis the same kind of Madness for a Man to ''doubt'' of any thing, as to ''hope for'', or ''fear it'', upon a mere Probability.|Wilkins, John|Of the principles and duties of natural religion p. 26}}

{{quote|If in any Matter offered to Consideration, the Probabilities on both sides e supposed to be equal: Yet even in this case, Men may be obliged to order their Actions in favor of that side, which appears to be most safe and advantageous for their own Interest.|Wilkins, John|Of the principles and duties of natural religion p. 32}}

{{quote|I call that ''Natural Religion'', which Men might know, and should be obliged unto, by the mere Principles of ''Reason'', improved by Consideration and Experience, without the help of ''Revelation''.|Wilkins, John|Of the principles and duties of natural religion p. 34}}

{{quote|The Works of ''Moses'' are by general consent acknowledged to be the most ancient Writings in the World. And though the design of them be to prescribe Doctrines and Rules for Religion, yet there is nothing offered in them by way of Proof or Persuasion concerning the ''Existence of God''; but it is a thing taken for granted, as being universally acknowledge and believed.|Wilkins, John|Of the principles and duties of natural religion p. 38}}

{{quote|Our Errors shall die with us.|Wilkins, John|Of the principles and duties of natural religion p. 85}}

{{quote|A Man may have such unworthy Notions of a Deity, that it would in some respects be as good, nay, much better, to be without a ''God'', than to have such a one, as he may frame.|Wilkins, John|Of the principles and duties of natural religion p. 88}}

{{quote|That two Bodies cannot be both at the same Time and in the same Place.|Wilkins, John|Of the principles and duties of natural religion p. 94}}

{{quotation|The Egyptians of old, tho' of all others the most infamous for their multiplicity of Gods, yet did assert One Maker and chief Governor of the World, under whom they did suppose several Subordinate Deities, who as his Deputies did preside over several parts of the Universe.
&lt;br/&gt;
The first occasion of these lesser Deities, was probably from a desire that Men had, to express their Gratitude to, and to honour the Memories of, such Heroical Persons, as in those first and ruder Ages of the World, had either by their Inventions or their Prowess, been highly Beneficial to Mankind, or to their own Countries; who whereupon were for such public Services, thought fit to be advanced to the highest Honour after their Deaths.|Wilkins, John|Of the principles and duties of natural religion p. 96-97}}

{{quote|...a ''Principle'', that whatever is begotten is ''corruptible'', and therefore and incapable of being properly a God.|Wilkins, John|Of the principles and duties of natural religion p. 98}}

{{quote|There are some who think so well of their own Minds, that they are able to take care of their own Business, and to provide for other Men's Affairs likewise: And yet are so absurd as to question, whether this great Universe, whereof they themselves are but a very inconsiderable part, be managed by any kind of ''Wisdom'' or Counsel, and not left wholly to ''Chance''.|Wilkins, John|Of the principles and duties of natural religion p. 117}}

===Principles of nature===

{{quote|Moses, Zoraster, Jesus, and Mahomet, are names celebrated in history; but what are they celebrated for? Have their institutions softened the savage ferocity of man? have they developed a clear system of principle, either moral, scientific, or philosophical? Have they encouraged the free and unqualified operation of intellect, or, rather, by their institutions, has not a gloom been thrown over the clearest subjects, and their examination prohibited under the severest penalties? The successors and followers of these men have adhered to the destructive lessons of their masters with undeviating tenacity. This has formed one of the most powerful obstacles to the progress of improvement, and still threatens, with external ''damnation'', that man who shall call in question the truth of their ''dogmas'', or the divinity of their systems.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 8}}

{{quote|It is natural to expect such an effect; the Being that is worshiped is presented as a pattern, and to imitate his properties is declared to be an essential duty. If such a Begin commit murder, or at any time gives orders to the human race to perform such cruel act, the order once given is the signal for military assassination, national vengeance, or the exercise of domestic resentment. The world becomes a field of blood, and man is slaughtered in the name of Heaven.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 12}}

{{quote|This variegated groupe of gods, devils, angels, ghosts, and witches, is what constitutes essentially the supernatural theology, or rather mythology of the Christian world. One sect, the most ancient, and like all others, in their own estimation, the most orthodox, have added one female divinity to complete the beauty and wonder of the scheme.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 12}}

{{quote|It is strange to observe, that in reasoning upon theological subjects, men are disposed to abandon the correct ground of moral decision, and contend that those actions which would be unjust in man, would nevertheless be just when performed by the Creator.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. 110}}

===World religions===

{{quote|If gods are as omnipotent and omniscient as claimed, they could easily have blazed the Commandments and other messages across the skies in flashing laser displays, or even used futuristic technologies of a thousand years hence.|William, Xavier|World Religions KL 971-973}}

{{quote|If he were the creator of all human beings, instead of being partial to the Jews, he was duty-bound to nurture the Chinese, the Amerindians and the Aborigines, and all people the world over.|William, Xavier|World Religions KL 975-976}}

{{quote|It is useful to know something of the manners of different nations, that we may be enabled to form a more correct judgement regarding our own, and be prevented from thinking that everything contrary to our customs is ridiculous and irrational.|Descartes, Rene|Discourse on Method p. 6}}

{{quote|There is seldom so much perfection in works composed of many separate parts, upon which different hands had been employed, as in those completed by a single master.|Descartes, Rene|Discourse on Method p. 10}}

{{quote|But I had become aware, even so early as during my college life, that no opinion, however absurd and incredible, can be imagined, which has not been maintained by some one of the philosophers.|Descartes, Rene|Discourse on Method p. 14}}

{{quote|I commenced with the simplest and most general truths, and that thus each truth discovered was a rule available in the discovery of subsequent ones.|Descartes, Rene|Discourse on Method p. 17}}

{{quote|An atheist in this sense of philosophical naturalist is somebody who believes there is nothing beyond the natural, physical world, no supernatural creative intelligence lurking behind the miracles - except in the sense of natural phenomena that we don't yet understand. If there is something that appears to lie beyond the natural world as it is now imperfectly understood, we hope eventually to understand it and embrace it within the natural. As ever when we unweave a rainbow, it will not become less wonderful.|Dawkins, Richard|The God Delusion p. 35}}

{{quote|The whole point of religious faith, its strength and chief glory, is that it does not depend on rational justification. The rest of us are expected to defend our prejudices. But ask a religious person to justify their faith and you infringe 'religious liberty.'|Dawkins, Richard. Rushdie, Salman|The God Delusion p. 45}}

{{quote|If people wish to love a 7th century preacher more than their own families, that's up to them, but nobody else is obliged to take it seriously...|Dawkins, Richard. Mueller|The God Delusion p. 49}}

{{quote|Any creative intelligence, of sufficient complexity to design anything, comes into existence only as the end produce of an extended process of gradual evolution. Creative intelligences, being evolved, necessarily arrive late in the universe, and therefore cannot be responsible for designing it. God, in the sense defined, is a delusion; and, as later chapters will show, a pernicious delusion.|Dawkins, Richard.|The God Delusion p. 52}}

{{quote|Life is too short to bother with the distinction between one figment of the imagination and many.|Dawkins, Richard.|The God Delusion p. 57}}

{{quote|To talk of immaterial existences is to talk of nothings. To say that the human soul, angels, god, are immaterial, is to say they are nothings, or that there is no god, no angels, no soul. I cannot reason otherwise.. without plunging into the fathomless abyss of dreams and phantasms. I am satisifed, and sufficently occupied with the things which are, without tormenting or troubling myself about those which may indeed be, but of which I have no evidence.|Dawkins, Richard. Jefferson, Thomas.|The God Delusion p. 63}}

{{quote|What is so special about believing? Isn't it just as likely that God would reward kindness, or generosity, or humility? Or sincerity?|Dawkins, Richard.|The God Delusion p. 131}}

{{quote|A deep understanding of Darwinism teaches us to be wary of the easy assumption that design is the only alternative to chance, and teaches us to seek out graded ramps of slowly increasing complexity.|Dawkins, Richard.|The God Delusion p. 139}}

{{quote|But the candidate solutions to the riddle of improbability are not, as is falsely implied, design and chance. They are design and natural selection... The answer is that natural selection is a cumulative process, which breaks the problem of improbability up into small pieces. Each of the small pieces is slightly improbable, but not prohibitively so... The creationist completely misses the point, because he insists on treating the genesis of statistical improbability as a single, one-off event.|Dawkins, Richard.|The God Delusion p. 145,147}}

{{quote|Creationists eagerly seek a gap in present-day knowledge or understanding. If an apparent gap is found, it is ''assumed'' that God, by default, must fill it.|Dawkins, Richard.|The God Delusion p. 151}}

{{quote|One of the truly bad effects of religion is that it teaches us that it is a virtue to be satisfied with not understanding.|Dawkins, Richard.|The God Delusion p. 152}}

{{quote|The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one.|Dawkins, Richard.|The God Delusion p. 194}}

{{quote|One facet of the many faces of religion is intense love focused on one supernatural person, i.e. God, plus reverence for icons of that person. Human life is driven largely by our selfish genes and by the processes of reinforcement. Much positive reinforcement derives from religion: warm and comforting feelings of being loved and protected in a dangerous world, loss of fear of death, help from the hills in response to prayer in difficult times, etc. Likewise, romantic love for another real person exhibits the same intense concentration on the other and related positive reinforcements. The state of being in love has many physiological accompaniments, such as sighing like a furnace.|Dawkins, Richard. Smythies, John|The God Delusion p. 215-216}}

{{quote|Martin Luther was well aware that reason was religion's arch-enemy, and he frequently warned of its dangers: 'Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has: it never comes to the aid of spiritual things, but more frequently than not struggles against the divine Word, treating with contempt all that emanates from God.'|Dawkins, Richard.|The God Delusion p. 221}}

{{quote|God and Country are an unbeatable team; they break all records for oppression and bloodshed.|Bunuel, Luis}}

{{quote|And all those commandments that make reference to 'thy neighbor' are equally exclusive. 'Neighbor' means fellow Jew. Moses Maimonides, the highly respected twelfth-century rabbi and physician, expounds the full meaning of 'Thou shalt not kill' as follows: 'If one slays a single Israelite, he transgresses a negative commandment, for Scripture says, Thou shalt not murder. If one murders willfully in the presence of witnesses, he is put to death by the sword. Needless to say, one is not put to death if he kills a heathen.' Needless to say!|Dawkins, Richard.|The God Delusion p. 288-289}}

{{quote|Some of the good principles can be found in holy books, but buried alongside much else that no decent person would wish to follow: and the holy books do not supply any rules for distinguishing the good principles from the bad.|Dawkins, Richard.|The God Delusion p. 298}}

{{quote|Any modern legal system would have prosecuted Abraham for child abuse. And if he had actually carried through his plan to sacrifice Isaac, we would have convicted him of first-degree murder.|Dawkins, Richard.|The God Delusion p. 300}}

{{quote|Something has shifted in the intervening decades. It has shifted in all of us, and the shift has no connection with religion. If anything, it happens in spite of religion, not because of it.|Dawkins, Richard.|The God Delusion p. 304}}

{{quote|Npolean said, 'Religion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet,' and with Seneca the Younger: 'Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rules as useful.'|Dawkins, Richard.|The God Delusion p. 313}}

{{quote|Individual atheists may do evil things but they don't do evil things in the name of atheism.|Dawkins, Richard.|The God Delusion p. 315}}

{{quote|Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.|Voltaire}}

{{quote|However misguided we may think them, they are motivated... by what they perceive to be righteousness, faithfully pursuing what their religion tells them.|Dawkins, Richard.|The God Delusion p. 344}}

{{quote|But what happens when our ability to rationally recognize the benefits of these restrictions conflicts with an instinctive aversion to them? The degree to which we are able to strike a balance of control in our lives has a significant bearing on our health.|Iyengar, Sheena|The Art of Choosing p. 14}}

{{quote|In 1957 Curt Richter, a prolific psychobiology researcher at John Hopkins School of Medicine, conducted an experiment... To study the effect of water temperature on endurance.. [he] placed dozens of rats into glass jars - one rodent per jar - and then filled the jars with water. Because the walls of these jars were too high and slick to climb, the rats were life in a literal sink-or-swim situation. Richter even had water jets blasting from above to force the rats below the surface if they tried to float idly instead of swimming for their lives. He then measured how long the rats swam - without food, rest, or chance of escape - before they drowned... Some continued swimming for an average of 60 hours.. while others sank almost immediately. In the next  round of the experiment, rather than throwing them into the water straightaway, researchers first picked up the rats several times, each time allowing them to wriggle free. After they had become accustomed to such handling, the rats were placed in the jars, blasted with water for several minutes, then removed and returned to their cages. This process was repeated multiple times. Finally the rats were put into the jars for the sink-or-swim test. This time none of the rats showed signs of giving up.. Their experience had taught them that they had some control over their outcome and, perhaps, that rescue was just around the corner.|Iyengar, Sheena|The Art of Choosing p. 4-5}}

{{quote|Love marriage is a fundamentally individualist endeavor, while an arranged marriage is quintessentially collectivist.|Iyengar, Sheena|The Art of Choosing p. 36}}

{{quote|Marriage inspired by love brings two people together &quot;under the influence of the most violent, most insane, most delusive, and most transient of passions. They are required to swear that they will remain in that excited, abnormal, and exhausting condition continually until death do them part.&quot;|Iyengar, Sheena|The Art of Choosing p. 43}}

{{quote|Studies consistently show that money can buy happiness, but only up to a certain point. Once one's basic needs are met, the value of the additional material goods that come with greater wealth diminishes rapidly.|Iyengar, Sheena|The Art of Choosing p. 132-133}}

{{quote|The result is that these few megacorporations decide exactly how much variety their brands will offer long before they ever reach the shelves, and its not in their interest to create true variety. Rather, they aim to maximize differences in image, thereby generating the illusion of variety and attracting the greatest diversity of consumers at the least cost to themselves.|Iyengar, Sheena|The Art of Choosing p. 155}}

{{quote|There are, in fact, two things, science and opinion; the former begets knowledge, the latter ignorance.|Hippocrates}}

{{quote|The Scottish distiller Thomas Dewar once said, 'Minds are like parachutes. They only function when open.' On the other hand, the New York Times publisher Arthur Hays Sluzberer stated: 'I believe in an open mind, but no so open that your brains fall out.'|Singh, Simon|Trick or Treatment p. 279}}

{{quote|It seems to me what is called for is an exquisite balance between two conflicting needs: the most skeptical scrutiny of all hypotheses that are served up to us and at the same time a great openness to new ideas. If you are only skeptical, then no new ideas make it through to you. You never learn anything new... On the other hand, if you are open to the point of gullibility and have not an ounce of skeptical sense in you, then you cannot distinguish useful ideas from worthless ones. If all ideas have equal validity then you are lost, because then it seems to me, no ideas have any validity at all.|Sagan, Carl|Lecture in Pasadena in 1987}}

{{quote|No one infers a god from the simple, from the known, from what is understood, but from the complex, from the unknown, and incomprehensible. Our ignorance is God; what we know is science.|Ingersoll, Robert|The Gods and Other Lectures p. 56}}

{{quote|&quot;But,&quot; says the religionist, &quot;you cannot explain everything; you cannot understand everything; and that which you cannot explain, that which you do not comprehend, is my God.&quot; - We are explaining more every day. We are understanding more every day; consequently your God is growing smaller every day.|Ingersoll, Robert|The Gods and Other Lectures p. 56}}

{{quote|Although many eminent men have endeavored to harmonize necessity and free will, the existence of evil, and the infinite power and goodness of God, they have succeeded only in producing learned and ingenious failures. Immense efforts have been made to reconcile ideas utterly inconsistent with the facts by which we are surrounded, and all persons who have failed to perceive the pretended reconciliation, have been denounced as infidels, atheists and scoffers.|Ingersoll, Robert|The Gods and Other Lectures pp. 61-62}}

{{quote|Religious persecution springs from a due admixture of love towards God and hatred towards man.|Ingersoll, Robert|The Gods and Other Lectures p. 79}}

{{quote|In spite of all religion, the geologist penetrated the earth, read her history in books of stone, and found, hidden within her bosom, souvenirs of all the ages.|Ingersoll, Robert|The Gods and Other Lectures p. 81}}

{{quote|The world is beginning to change because the people are beginning to think. To think is to advance. Everywhere the great minds are investigating the creeds and superstitions of men - the phenomena of nature, and the laws of things.|Ingersoll, Robert|The Gods and Other Lectures p. 114}}

{{quote|The Church is, and always has been, incapable of a forward movement. Religion always looks back... Progress is born of doubt and inquiry. The Church never doubts - never inquires. To doubt is heresy - to inquire is to admit that you do not know - the Church does neither.|Ingersoll, Robert|The Gods and Other Lectures p. 151-152}}

{{quote|Infidelity is liberty; all religion is slavery. In every creed man is the slave of God - woman is the slave of man and the sweet children are the slaves of all.|Ingersoll, Robert|The Gods and Other Lectures p. 159}}

{{quote|Any system of religion that shocks the mind of a child cannot be a true system; the world is my country, and to do good my religion.|Paine, Thomas}}

{{quote|Just in proportion that the human race has advanced, the Church has lost power. There is no exception to this rule. No nation ever materially advanced that held strictly to the religion of its founders. No nation ever gave itself wholly to the control of the Church without losing its power its honor, and existence. Every Church pretends to have found the exact truth. This is the end of progress. Why pursue that which you have? Why investigate when you know?|Ingersoll, Robert|The Gods and Other Lectures p. 153}}

{{quote|Over the vast plain, called life, we are all travelers, and not one traveler is perfectly certain that he is going in the right direction. True it is that no other plain is so well supplied with guide-boards. At every turn and crossing you will find them, and upon each one is written the exact direction and distance. One great trouble is however, that these boards are all different, and the result is that most travelers are confused in proportion to the number they read. Thousands of people are around each of these signs, and each one is doing his best to convince the traveler that his particular board is the only one upon which the least reliance can be placed, and that if his road is taken the reward for so doing will be infinite and eternal, while all other roads are said to lead to hell, and all makers of the other guide-boards are declared to be heretics, hypocrites and liars. &quot;Well,&quot; says a traveler, &quot;you may be right in what you say, but allow me at least to read some of the other directions and examine a little into their claims. I wish to rely a little upon my own judgement in a matter of so great importance.&quot; &quot;No, sir,&quot; shouts the zealot, &quot;that is the very thing you are not allowed to do. You must go my way without investigation, or you are as good as damned already.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; says the traveler, &quot;if that is so, I believe I had better go your way.&quot; And so most of them go along, taking the word of those who know as little as themselves. Now and then comes one who in spite of all threats, calmly examines the claims of all, and as calmly rejects them all. These travelers take roads of their own, and are denounced by all others, as infidels and atheists.|Ingersoll, Robert|The Gods and Other Lectures pp. 177-179}}

{{quote|The truth is, our government is not founded upon the rights of gods, but upon the rights of men. Our Constitution was framed, not to declare and uphold the deity of Christ, but the sacredness of humanity. Ours is the first government made by the people and for the people. It is the only nation with which the gods have had nothing to do.|Ingersoll, Robert|The Gods and Other Lectures p. 199}}

{{quote|The fact is, we have no national religion, and no national God; but every citizen is allowed to have a religion and a God of his own, or to reject all religions and deny the existence of all gods.|Ingersoll, Robert|The Gods and Other Lectures p. 202}}

{{quote|Christianity cannot live in peace with any other form of faith. If that religion be true, there is but one savior, one inspired book, and but one little narrow grass-grown path that leads to heaven. Such a religion is necessarily uncompromising, unreasoning, aggressive, and insolent. Christianity has held all other creeds and forms in infinite contempt, divided the world into enemies and friends, and verified the awful declaration of its founder - a declaration that wet with blood the word he came to bring..|Ingersoll, Robert|Some mistakes of Moses p. VII}}

{{quote|To hate man and worship God seems to be the sum of all the creeds.|Ingersoll, Robert|Some mistakes of Moses p. 15}}

{{quote|To believe without evidence, or in spite of it, is accounted as righteousness to the sincere and humble Christian.|Ingersoll, Robert|Some mistakes of Moses p. 19}}

{{quote|It is what people do not know, that they persecute each other about. Science will bring, not a sword, but peace.|Ingersoll, Robert|Some mistakes of Moses p. 28}}

{{quote|But how much greater is the proportion of genius which is developed into actual results by social intercourse than by solitary reflection! The real reason for it is, that now and then a circle is formed whose members cultivate the art of mutual expression and of mutual intelligence - in other words the art of conversation - and thereby succeed in a short time in imparting to each other not merely a general knowledge of what they themselves know, but also what they themselves are.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 20}}

{{quote|It will therefore be readily understood, that people of ability greatly increase that ability, and enable one another to produce great works, not merely by mutually meeting, but by cultivating the art of conversation so that they may give and take knowledge to the greatest possible advantage.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 21}}

{{quote|The duller the intellect and the more limited the knowledge and experience may be of the person with whom you talk, the more will he wish to hear himself, and the less will he desire to listen to you, save for applause and flattery.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation pp. 24-25}}

{{quote|Remember that there are few persons from whom you cannot learn something, and that everything is worth knowing.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 25}}

{{quote|Many people excel in courteously evading or getting rid of the conversation of others, but the lady or gentleman has mastered a much higher grade in the &quot;art of living&quot; who can listen with interest to all, especially to the poor and humble, without manifesting impatience, indifference or affectation of interest.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 26}}

{{quote|While silent in conversation and while listening, never stare away to the right or left, and be careful to avoid all appearance of inattention or of abstractedness. Look steadily at the speaker - if he or she be a person of sense it will be an admonition to be concise, for it is not kind to compel prolonged attention from those who are so courteous as to bestow it.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 27}}

{{quote|Strive by every means in your power to avoid the reputation of a tattler. Never repeat to a soul a syllable which was not intended for repetition. Make it a point of personal pride to be reserved on this subject. Few persons seem to be aware of the advantages which are to be derived from having the character of never repeating anything that is told them.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 29}}

{{quote|A single bit of gossip in circulation stamped with your name, will excite general distrust and doubt as to your fidelity.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 30}}

{{quote|Bear continually in mind the fact that in the art of conversation the secret of success lies not so much in knowing what to say, as in what to avoid saying.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 31}}

{{quote|You must establish a genial and sympathetic tone between yourself and the one with whom you discourse, so that in the end your friend may retain the conviction that he has said nothing which sober second thought would disapprove, or to which you would recur with doubt.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 32}}

{{quote|To be able to resolutely avoid listening to comments on the family affairs, intentions, or mistakes of other people, requires not only firmness but tact, and the one who is possessed of this will seldom be involved in difficulties resulting from avoiding gossip.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 33}}

{{quote|Strictly adhere to the rule of doing as you would be done by at all times, and on all occasions, firmly resisting all temptation to the contrary.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 34}}

{{quote|Never say anything unpleasant when it can by any possibility be avoided.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 40}}

{{quote|But unfortunately very few observe the degree to which the abuses of witty sarcasm out-balance its benefits. A majority of all quarrels and ill-feelings spring from this source.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 41}}

{{quote|Persons who habitually tease in any manner whatever, directly or indirectly, may be possessed of many excellent qualities, but they are not entitled to true respect; nor is any one, who fails in respect towards others, or in regard for their feelings.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 44}}

{{quote|The whole art of pleasing is more or less directly that of complimenting.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 49}}

{{quote|The most benevolent or generous act to an equal, loses much of its value if utterly devoid of compliment.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 49}}

{{quote|Women - or men - who are not familiar with the world, or skilled in conversation, invariably express, and perhaps feel, a dislike to compliments. They are either suspicious and doubt the sincerity of all praise, or, as is more frequently the case, they find themselves unable to turn the compliment with an adroit answer or graceful reply, and are consequently rather vexed than pleased with it.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation pp. 49-50}}

{{quote|Of all compliments the most agreeable are those in which the one paying them seems to be unconscious of so doing, and is at the same time warmly in earnest.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation pp. 51-52}}

{{quote|All of them, however, who have any claims to culture, will, when the first tribute is paid, be best pleased with appreciative compliments paid to their intelligence, accomplishments, &quot;spirit,&quot; kindness of heart, tastes, habits, hopes, and associations.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 52}}

{{quote|He who is continually busy with reflecting on what people think and say of each other, will be quite certain to keep a place for himself with the rest. This is the reason why in very gossiping circles there are a few efforts of genius, and few genial and earnest minds, for all is killed by reflected egotism.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 59}}

{{quote|Do not in conversation refer too frequently to scenes in which you have figured; to great people whom you have known; to your travels, your successes, or to anything on which you may be supposed to congratulate yourself...

There are men who carry this to an absurd degree of affection, and abstain from the slightest reference to their travels, or what they have seen, or of what they have been a part of.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation pp. 61-62}}

{{quote|Avoid very frequent conversation on any subject in which you are notoriously interested.

{{quote|Beware of peculiar form of vanity which consists in making confidences of your private affairs to many people, and in binding every acquaintance to solemn secrecy as to this or that matter relative to yourself or friends.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 64}}

{{quote|Never seek to make captial in general conversation by communicating to any mortal whatever, your misfortunes, grievances and losses.

{{quote|In short, never allude in any way, or under any circumstances, where it can be avoided, to your own excellencies or defects.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 65}}

{{quote|One may repeat a hundred times: &quot;be industrious! be thrifty! be enterprizing!&quot; -- but unless the advice be accompanied with some practical illustration or application, its result will in most cases be to irritate.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 66}}

{{quote|Never talk simply to hear yourself talk, or for effect.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 67}}

{{quote|Do not tell a story unless you think it new, or are at least confident that it will be new to your auditors. Let it be in place - that is to say, illustrative of something which has occurred in conversation, for a story forced in at all hazards is very ridiculous.|Leland, Charles Godfrey|The Art of Conversation p. 82}}

{{quote|One of Pavlov's students, Shenger-Krestovnikova, trained a dog to discriminate between a circle and an ellipse. At first the figures were very different and the dog easily learned the discrimination. Then the ellipse was made progressively more circular. Her dog was finally able to discriminate between a circle and an ellipse with axes in a ratio of 8:7. This was a remarkably acute discrimination; but, when Shenger-Krestovnikova changed the ratio to 9:8, she saw a dramatic change in the dog's behavior: &quot;The whole behavior of the animal underwent an abrupt change. The hitherto quiet dog began to squeal on its stand, kept wriggling about, tore off with its teeth the apparatus for mechanical stimulation of the skin, and bit through the tubes connecting the animal's room with the observer, a behavior which had never happened before. On being taken into the experimental room the dog now barked violently, which was also contrary to its usual custom; in short it presented all the symptoms of acute neurosis.&quot;|Hothersall, David|History of Psychology pp. 358-359}}

{{quote|Some day all this will be better organized, and still better. That is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster toward the subjugation of Nature. In the end, wisely and carefully we shall re-adjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit our human needs.|Wells, H.G.|The Time Machine p. 72}}

{{quote|For a queer notion of Grant Allen's came into my head and amused me. If each generation dies and leaves ghosts, he argues, the world at least will get overcrowded with them. On that theory they would have become very thick in eight hundred thousand years from now, and it was no great wonder to see four all at once.|Wells, H.G.|The Time Machine p. 105}}

{{quote|So, in the end, you would have above ground the Haves, pursuing health, comfort, and beauty, and below ground the Have-nots; the workers, getting continually adapted to their labor.|Wells, H.G.|The Time Machine p. 116}}

{{quote|Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change. Only those animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety of needs and dangers.|Wells, H.G.|The Time Machine p. 187}}

{{quote|This is the paradox of gratitude: although the evidence is clear that cultivating gratitude in our life and in our attitude to life allows us to flourish, it can be difficult to accomplish. Developing and sustaining a grateful outlook on life is easier said than done because the choice for gratitude rarely comes without some real effort. A number of evidence-based strageties, including self-guided journaling, reflective thinking, letter writing, and gratitude visits, have shown to be effective in creating sustainable gratefulness.|Emmons, Robert|Gratitude Works p. ix}}

{{quote|Our minds do have a built-in tendency to perceive an input as negative|Emmons, Robert|Gratitude Works p. 5}}

{{quote|There is frequently a divide between what we know we ought to do and how we actually wind up behaving. Psychologists call this the knowledge to performance gap.|Emmons, Robert|Gratitude Works p. 6}}

{{quote|Simply, for example, develop a habit of looking at each thought as you would a plant. If it is worthy, if it fits the plan you desire for your mind, cultivate it. If not, replace it. How do you get it out of your mind? Simply by putting in its place two or three thoughts of love or worship, for no mind can dwell on more than two or three thoughts at one time.|Emmons, Robert|Gratitude Works p. 8}}

{{quote|When we are grateful, we affirm that sources of goodness exist in our lives. By writing each day, we magnify and expand on these good sources.|Emmons, Robert|Gratitude Works p. 22}}

{{quote|Gratitude journaling promotes the savoring of positive life experiences and situations so that we can distill the maximum satisfaction and enjoyment from them.|Emmons, Robert|Gratitude Works p. 26}}

{{quote|And because you can't be grateful and negative at the same time, it counteracts feelings of envy, anger, greed, and other states harmful to happiness|Emmons, Robert|Gratitude Works p. 26}}

{{quote|Writing helps you organize thoughts, facilitate integration, and helps you accept your own experiences and put them in context.|Emmons, Robert|Gratitude Works pp. 27-28}}

{{quote|When we lament opportunities lost or regrets over what might have been, these comparisons may be counterproductive to our mental well-being. But we can harness the power of this kind of thinking by reminding ourselves of how much worse life might be than it is or how we may have never received a particular blessing in our lives.|Emmons, Robert|Gratitude Works p. 38}}

{{quote|After a reward has become routine or expected, dopamine cell firing is substantially reduced.|Emmons, Robert|Gratitude Works p. 44}}

{{quote|Yet we must remember that relationships between neural processes and felt emotions are correlational, not casual.|Emmons, Robert|Gratitude Works p. 45}}

{{quote|Putting feelings into words can make a person feel better because doing so dampens activity in the parts of the brain associated with negativity.|Emmons, Robert|Gratitude Works p. 60}}</text>

{{quote|The relentless and inconsistent commands, the confusing signals and the confounding messages from the Patriarch give rise to a primordial guilt complex. This leads to the &quot;You're-OK, I'm-not-OK&quot; syndrome, especially vis-a-vis the Parent. ''The concept of original sin must have arisen from the guilt complexes originating from the harangues we received in our childhood''. Neither baptism nor any other initiation cermony can really mitigate this guilt complexes born of the contrary and often confusing messages, and the thundering 'No!'s  we faced in our infancy and childhood.|William, Xavier|World Religions pp. 12-13}}

{{quote|That man stands in the same relative condition with his Maker he ever did stand, since man existed, and that it is his greatest consolation to think so. Let him believe this, and he will live more consistent and morally, than by any other system.|Paine, Thomas|The age of reason p. 24}}

{{quote|Moral impurity assumes a ''new shape'', and becomes ''transferable'' through successive generations. Though none of this man's descendants could possibly be partakers of this original criminality, they are, nevertheless, implicated in the consequences and effects of his primary apostasy.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 29}}</text>

{{quote|The concept of fanaticism enables us not only to place a value judgement on those who oppose our ideals, but also to condemn out of hand their mode of behavior, without delving deeper, simply by saying: &quot;They're fanatics.&quot;|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 4}}

{{quote|Whatever their basic personalities, they seem to have invested their entire psychological energy in the pursuit of an exclusive and absolute goal to which all else was subordinated. This obsessional investment was built in intolerance, hatred, and aggressiveness against any presumed enemy, anyone likely not to share the pursuit of the millenarian goal which absorbed them.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 14}}

{{quote|By its violence and fervor in hunting down suspects, the politico-Jewish sect of the Zealots or Sicarii bequeathed to psychiatry the concept of &quot;zealotry&quot; (from the Greek zelotupos, meaning &quot;jealous&quot;), designating both maniacal jealousy and argumentative faith.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 19}}

{{quote|In France, Great Sovereign, to increase the curse. Our ills are risen from a sacred source. Religion, raging with inhuman zeal. Arms every hand, and points the fatal steel.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 24}}

{{quote|He who maintains his enthusiastic madness by murder is a fanatic.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 28}}

{{quote|[Fanaticism -] A blind and passionate zeal born of superstitious opinions giving rise to unjust and cruel acts which are committed, not only without shame or remorse, but on the contrary with a sort of joy and relief or consolation. Fanaticism is thus merely superstition translated into action.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 28}}

{{quote|Indeed, many of the metaphors Voltaire uses [to describe fanaticism] smack of disease. Thus, according to the Encyclopedie, it is an &quot;aberration of the imagination,&quot; a &quot;sickness of the people,&quot; a &quot;sickness of religion which affects the brain,&quot; &quot;a heavenly epilepsy,&quot; and &quot;it is to medical practitioners that such sick people should be sent.&quot;|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 29}}

{{quote|For the effect of philosophy is to render the soul tranquil, and fanaticism and tranquility are totally imcompatible.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 30}}

{{quote|There is a kind of fanaticism in the love of country which could be called a cult of the hearth. It is based on customs, laws, and religion, and it is especially for its religious content that it merits even more the name fanaticism.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 31}}

{{quote|In order for fanaticism to exist, there must be an upheaval ''within a faith'' - a faith in God, but also in the race, the nation, the state, progress, the revolution, production.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 32}}

{{quote|But in our meaning, these fanaticisms in no way differ in the essentials, and indeed, according to the author himself, they represent merely variations on the same phenomenon. Only their object varies.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 32}}

{{quote|In his illusion of having found the absolute and superhuman, the fanatic believes himself to be in possession of ''the'' truth, which confers upon him omniscience, omnipotence, and invulnerability-all superhuman conditions.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 36}}

{{quote|The paranoid-dichotomic system-true-false, black-white, friend-enemy--engenders a radicalization of thought, channeling aggression toward an enemy.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 36}}

{{quote|What distinguishes [the fanatic] from other members of suffering humanity like ourselves is that he finds security, a way of being reassured, in the fanatical system in which he invests so much faith.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 37}}

{{quote|The fanaticizers break with tradition, stray from the beaten path for an idea or an ideal which becomes in their mind an absolute, worth sacrificing themselves and others for.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 37}}

{{quote|[Fanatics have] contempt and indifference for everything other than the object of their passion; an unshakable certitude in the rightness of their ideas...|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 38}}

{{quote|At the individual level, on the other hand, fanaticism resembles a state of mind where the subject is &quot;obsessed&quot; by a series of representations which end up taking over his entire mental space, pushing aside his former evolution. The ego can be said to be flooded with fanatical ideas and representations to the point that eventually the former man no longer exists: a ''new man'' is born, as in the liturgy for consecrating monks.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 41}} 

{{quote|That the fanatic shares none of the animist's belief in spirits matters not at all; he will still have a narcissistic, egocentric way of thinking (he alone is always right), a belief in the omnipotence of his thought (thanks to which he will be able magically to change the world, to bring forth paradise), and finally, a projective thought which rids him of any trace of weakness and human flaw.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 41}}

{{quote|Human life in common is only made possible when a majority comes together which is stronger than any separate individual and which remains united against all separate individuals. The power of this community is then set up as &quot;right&quot; in opposition to the power of the individual, which is condemned as &quot;brute force.&quot; This replacement of the power of the individual by the power of the community constitutes the decisive step of civilization. The essence of it lies in the fact that the members of the community restrict themselves in their possibilities of satisfaction, whereas the individual knew no such restrictions.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 44}}

{{quote|The cornerstone of civilization is the commandment that &quot;man shall not kill the neighbor whom he hates or who is in his way&quot;.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 46}}

{{quote|Absolutely no idea or ideology - including the scientific idea - should be above investigation as to its ontology, origins, and evolution.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 47}}

{{quote|&quot;Manipulation of the masses&quot; was the formula found to characterize the behavior of certain states. Thus, on the one hand, the masses are shown an enemy to bring down, with the promise that they will attain happiness... on the other hand, the organisms that traditionally monitor democratic freedoms, such as the free press, public opinion, and the parliamentary system, are ridiculed and belitted, thus eliminating the possibility of effective checks by the citizens.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 48}}

{{quote|Psychoanalysis reveal the aggressiveness, envy, and jealously that disturb the inner lives of average, peaceful, civilized men; it also shows how eager they are to seize upon cheap rationalizations allowing them to release their tensions.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 49}}

{{quote|If the goals of human civilization - to live together with an optimum of pleasure - are to be maintained, we must also be able to arm ourselves against the enemies of this civilization. Among these enemies are the fanatics - not only those of our projections, i.e., the ones from the outside, but also those we carry within us, our &quot;demons&quot;.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 51}}

{{quote|If man does not accept his imperfection and failings, he is forced to project them outside through a paranoid mechanism so as not to be crushed under the weight of his guilt feelings. This contradiction between life instinct and death instinct is encompassed in fanaticism: destruction in the name of the search for an ideal world.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 52}}

{{quote|If you want to expel religion from our European civilization, you can only dot it by means of another system of doctrines; and such a system would from the outset take over all the psychological characteristics of religion - the same sanctity, rigidity and intolerance, the same prohibition of thought - for its own defense.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 53}}

{{quote|We cannot ignore the fact that young people are drawn to sectarian groupings, religious or secular depending on the country, fanatical in either case.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 56}}

{{quote|It is thus when the consensus concerning the ideals of a civilization breaks down that the need for change is felt, or that the end of a civilization draws near.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 57}}

{{quote|Christianity's advance in the Roman world was facilitated and accelerated by the discredit that had fallen upon the pagan cults the new religion sought to supplant.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 62}}

{{quote|A man becomes a hero in a culture because he is perceived as having mastered the problems confronting his society, especially when the problem is represented by evil as the particular culture sees it.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 63}}

{{quote|The division of the world into two parties, the good and the evil, is peculiar to the thought of the fanatic. He himself is among the &quot;good,&quot; while evil is projected on the Other, the enemy against whom he is obliged to wage an endless struggle for self-preservation. This struggle is all the fiercer in that he projects onto the Other all the evil and undesirable aspects of his own personality.|Haynal, Molnar, Puymege|Fanaticism a historical and psychological study p. 64}}

===Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion===

{{quote|When the heathens worshiped their superior divinities, who were supposed to have their residence above the clouds, they did it not only on mountains, and in high places but on high altars, thinking that by that means they had a nearer access to the objects of their worship. For this reason the Hebrews were directed not to build such altars, or to worship in such places.|Priestley, Joseph|Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion p. 159}}

{{quote|Among the Egyptians the idea of one supreme God was, from the earliest times, connected with the belief of inferior divinities, residing in the various parts of nature, whence arose the worship of those parts of nature. According to the mythology of the Greeks, those inferior deities sprung from chaos. Pythagoras supposed the region of the air to be peopled with these beings whom he calls ''gods'', ''demons'', and ''heroes'', according to their rank, these last approaching the nearest to the nature of man.|Priestley, Joseph|Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion p. 199}}

===New Evidence That Demands A Verdict===

{{quote|I believe that the only way to get to the truth is to throw out all preconceived ideas.|McDowell, Josh|New Evidence That Demands A Verdict p. 686}}

{{quote|Truth is not determined by majority vote.|McDowell, Josh|New Evidence That Demands A Verdict p. 563. Geisler, BECA, 387}}

===Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit===

{{quote|The first of these rules, as laid down by Sir Isaac Newton, is that we are to admit no more causes of things than are sufficient to explain appearances; and the second is that, to the same effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes.|Priestley, Joseph|Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit p. 8}}

{{quote|And my readiness to abandon all this hypothesis, whenever a better, that is, one more nearly corresponding to facts, shall be suggested to me.|Priestley, Joseph|Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit p. 41}}

===Principles of nature===

{{quote|Moses, Mahomet, and Jesus, can lay as little claim to moral merti, or to the character of the benefactors of mankind, as any three men that ever lived upon the face of the earth. They were all of them imposters; two of them notorious murders in practice, and the other a murderer in principle; and their existence united, has, perhaps, cost the human race more blood, and produced more substantial misery, than all other fanatics of the world.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. 204}}

{{quote|All the theological systems, that ever have been written, have never thrown a particle of light upon this most interesting inquiry; they have established precepts, some few of which are good, and others extremely immoral; but no analysis of the physical or moral powers of man has ever been exhibited; no development of the principle of causation, or the nature of those effects, which have essentially resulted from the constitution of animal or intellectual existence.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. 213}}

{{quote|The spirit of sectarianism spread itself far and wide, dividing and diversifying the opinions of the Church, and each new sectary seemed to be endowed with a new portion of that rancorous malignity, which has so universally marked the conduct of those whose pride and folly have led them to conclude, that they spoke in the name of heaven, and were the favourites of the Most High.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. 239}}

{{quote|The passion for truth is silenced by answers which have the weight of undisputed authority. - Paul Tillich|Harris, Thomas|I'm OK - You're OK pg. 18}}

{{quote|During this period of his actual dependency upon his parents for security, however tenuous this security may be, it is likely he will accept the parents' verdicts... This is how prejudice is transmitted. ''For a little child, it may be safer to believe a lie than to believe his own eyes and ears.''|Harris, Thomas|I'm OK - You're OK pg. 38}}

{{quote|It takes only one generation for a good thing to become a bad thing.|Harris, Thomas|I'm OK - You're OK pg. 234}}

{{quote|The ideas enshrined in dogma may include good and wise ideas, but dogma is bad in itself because it is accepted as ''good without examination''.|Harris, Thomas|I'm OK - You're OK pg. 234}}

{{quote|We cannot be judgmental about religious experiences of others for there is no certain, objective way to know what really happens to them. We cannot say that one person's experience is genuine and another's is not.|Harris, Thomas|I'm OK - You're OK pg. 243}}

===Three inquiries===

{{quote|Here Paul expressly declares, that by one man, and not by a fallen angel, sin entered the world. (Rom 5:12-14)|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 23}}

{{quote|The Jews assert that there were two secretaries [in the court], the one being seated to the right of the judge, who wrote the sentence of not guilty, the other to the left, who wrote the sentence of condemnation.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 60}}

{{quote|The Mehestani, who were disciples of Zoroaster, believed in the immortality of the soul, in rewards and punishments, after death, and in the resurrection of the body; at the time of which resurrection, all the bad would be purged by fire, and associated with the good.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 74}}

{{quote|According to Jahn's account, Zoroaster disciples did not believe in endless punishment. At &quot;the resurrection, all the bad would be purged by fire, and associated with the good&quot; was their belief, and this accords with the opinions of some Christians in the present day.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 75}}

{{quote|The history of the Christian church shows, that many heathen opinions were incorporated with Christianity, and increased from bad to worse, until what was called Christianity, became worse than heathenism itself. The first converts were Jews, and vast multitudes of converts were also made from among the Gentiles. Such continued to retain many of their former false opinions. When Christianity became the religion of the Roman empire, men, formerly heathen priests and philosophers, became teachers in the Christian church, so that it soon became popular, but greatly corrupted.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 92-93}}

{{quote|The highest church [of the Zoroasterians] above all was the fire temple, where the Archimagus resided, which was had in the same veneration with them as the temple of Mecca among the Mahometans, to which every one of that sect thought themselves obliged to make a pilgrimage once in their lives|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 94}}

{{quote|Many a prayer has been made for the downfall of Mahomet and the destruction of Paganism: but who ever heard a prayer made for the destruction of Magianism or the religion of Zoroaster? But why not? Is it not because the creeds of the different [Christian] sects and that of Zoroaster are very similar? From his Lord God the Pope, down to the lowest dissenter, all firmly hold some articles invented by Zoroaster.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 95-96}}

{{quote|It has been alleged that the New Testament speaks more frequently and explicitly about the devil and satan than the Old. Let us see how this matter stands. The term satan occurs third-four times in the Old Testament, and is fifteen times rendered adversary, or by some similar word. But though it occurs thirty-five times in the New Testament, it is not rendered by any word.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 97}}

{{quote|But it is well known, that the words daimon or daimonion, have no reference to that being Christians called the devil, but to demons or dead men deified|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 97-98}}

{{quote|Dr. Campbell says, Dissert. vi. -- &quot;It is a common idiom among the Jews, to put spirit before any quality ascribed to a person, whether it be good or bad, mental or corporeal. Thus the spirit of fear, the spirit of meekness, the spirit of slumber, the spirit of jealousy, are used to express habitual infirmity, which was certainly true of this woman, for she could in no wise lift up herself &quot;for eighteen years.&quot; This complaint medical men have called &quot;the rigidity of the back bone.&quot; Notice when our Lord restored her, he does not command satan to leave this woman, nor does he rebuke him, but says -- &quot;woman, thou art loosed.&quot; Loosed from satan? No, thou art loosed from thine infirmity|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 102}}

{{quote|Well, what satan entered into Judas? I answer, ''the spirit of opposition to Jesus, the purpose to betray him.''|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 104}}

{{quote|What is a remarkable fact, ... satan is never said to have entered into the Jews. And why not? because they had always been a satan or adversary to our Lord.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 105}}

{{quote|What is meant by satan filling the heart, is explained to mean, Ananias conceiving this thing in his heart.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 106}}

{{quote|Compare Col i. 13, where we read of men turned from &quot;the power of darkness&quot;. Accordingly some read the passage before us: &quot;to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light, even from the power of satan unto God.&quot; The darkness of ignorance, superstition, and wickedness, were the satan from which Paul turned men, and this he did by the light of the glorious gospel of Christ.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 108}}

{{quote|The term spirit, is often used in Scripture as equivalent to person, or for the person himself.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 108}}

{{quote|At Corinth, prostitution formed a part of the worship of the gods.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 110}}

{{quote|Rev. ii. 24, &quot;But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, (as many as have not this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of satan, as they speak) I will put upon you none other burden.&quot; Here again it is only necessary to translate the word satan adversary, and all the idea of a fallen angel disappears. -- The deep things, or depths of satan, are the depths of the adversary. It is said that the Gnostics called their mysteries the deep things of God and the deep things of Bythus. And Lowman calls it the deep arts of deceit and error.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 114}}

{{quote|Mr. Stuart then tell us that &quot;the son of any thing, according to the oriental idiom, may be either what is closely connected with it, dependent on it, like it, the consequence of it, worthy of it, &amp;c.&quot; He adds, &quot;every kind of relation or resemblance, whether real or imaginary, every kind of connexion is characterized by calling it the son of that thing to which it stands thus related, or with which it is connected.&quot;|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 125}}

{{quote|The Jews had been &quot;murderous persons&quot; from the beginning of the gospel dispensation. From our Lord's birth to his death they sought to slay him.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 127}}

{{quote|The law is expressly said to have been the accuser of the Jews, John v. 45-47.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 135}}

{{quote|But, are our orthodox brethren aware, that their faith in the devil influencing men to sin, militates against the doctrine of total depravity? What need is there of such a being's assistance? Total depravity is sufficient without him to produce all manner of wickedness. If men would be less wicked, without the devil's influence, they they are not so bad but he can make them worse: and who can tell but they might all be very good if he would only let them alone.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 145}}

{{quote|What is not understood and believed, is little regarded, soon forgotten, and easily parted with; especially if public prejudice be against it.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 157}}

{{quote|&quot;It was the opinion both of the Jews and heathen,&quot; says Whitby on this text, &quot;that the air was full of spirits called demons; that from the earth to the firmament all things were full of these companies or rules; and that there was a prince over them who was called the governor of the world, that is, of the darkness of it.&quot; This agrees to Zoroaster's angel of darkness, who was considered the author and director of all evil.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 171}}

{{quote|It is a fact, that in every country where the Bible is not known, or not studied where it is known, there superstitious notions have prevailed concerning witches, evil spirits, ghosts, and the devil: and just in proportion as it has been known and studied all such superstitions have gradually been exploded and renounced by the people.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 178}}

{{quote|With most people, reason, common sense, and the Bible, had nothing to do in forming such opinions, but they have been implicitly received by tradition from their fathers. They say they believe in them, but cannot tell why, except that they were so taught, for they have never exercised their reason or studied the Bible to see whether they are true or false. Even when a person determines to examine such opinions, his early prejudices within, and popular opinion without, overawe and deter him from giving free scope to his investigations. We speak here from experience, for these have been powerfully felt in the course of this discussion.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 181}}

{{quote|No scripture writer ever says a word about the devil as the tormentor of any one.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 182}}

{{quote|Error supposes truth, as counterfeit money supposes current, but is it true that every error is a corruption of truth?|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 184}}

{{quote|By such opinions, men's attention has been turned away from the true devil within them, to an invisible, imaginary being, called the devil, without them.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 191}}

{{quote|My object is to examine what is truth, and embrace it whatever it may be, for this only can stand, or be of any real benefit to the human race.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 228}}

{{quote|Christians do not seem to think of any punishment in this life for disobedience to God. No; it is all carried into a future state of existence, and considered to be endless.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 249}}

{{quote|Before the world, signifies before the age, and from the beginning of the world, means from the beginning of the age. If it be asked, what age? The answer is, the age or dispensation of the law of Moses.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 269}}

{{quote|For since Christ sat down on his glorious throne, he has been judging the nations of the world in righteousness, and such of them as would not serve him, he has broken in pieces like a potter's vessel.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 316}}

{{quote|It is concluded by many, that this chapter [Matthew 24,25] contains an account of the end of this world, and the day of judgement. But why is such a conclusion drawn? For certainly, though it speaks of everlasting fire, everlasting punishment, and life eternal, it gives no intimation that these are suffered or enjoyed in another state of existence.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 321}}

{{quote|God must be very merciful to the devil, to excuse him so long a time from eternal misery, yet send all the Sodomites there when he burnt up their city.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 337}}

{{quote|Many people seem to think, that &quot;forever and ever,&quot; expresses endless duration, but if duly considered we think it leads to the reverse conclusion, for the very repetition of &quot;forever&quot; implies, that the first forever was of limited duration.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 348-349}}

{{quote|We can sincerely say that we have sought after the truth, and from the love of truth, for this only can stand, when all human devices in religion shall fall. If we have not found the truth, but have embraced error, we hold ourselves in readiness to attend to whatever can be said on the other side. Truth can never suffer by calm, candid discussion, but error shuns the light, deprecates investigation, and is ever ready to cry heresy, and that the church is in danger.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 355}}

{{quote|It is evident, the New Testament writers speak of demons, and of persons being possessed with them, not as a new thing under the sun, but as a popular and common thing, and speak in the common language of the age about them.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 359}}

{{quote|To suppose them real things, evil spirits, is not only contrary to the Scriptures, but admits that they can work something very like miracles, in tormenting mankind.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 362}}

{{quote|The Hebrew word [satyrs] here [Isai. xiii 21] is soir, which some say mean hairy beings [bigfoot].|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 363}}

{{quote|We may also safely conclude, that the Jews before they went to Babylon, had heard of and known something about demons, for they had sacrificed even their sons and daughters to them... But it was not until the Jews had gone to Babylon, that they learned that demons were evil spirits, or regarded them as such.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 364}}

{{quote|The heathen ascribed all good things to their good gods, but evil things to their evil spirits [or gods]. But Job ascribed both to the true God.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 365}}

{{quote|Dr. Campbell observes -- &quot;that it is a common idiom among the Jews to put spirit before any quality ascribed to a person, whether good or bad, mental or corporal thus, the spirit of fear is used to express habitual fear,&quot; etc. It is easily perceived from this, that any bad thing might be turned into an evil spirit by connecting the word spirit with it. And this was the ore easily done, if the term spirit was applide to imaginary beings, supposed to do men evil. They were personified, and spoken of as real beings, and were believed by many to have an actual existence, and could do them good or evil.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 366}}

{{quote|It is said by Theophrastus -- &quot;music cures many disorders of the mind and body - such as faintings, fears, and disorders of the mind.&quot;|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 367}}

{{quote|Maimonides observes -- &quot;that the Jews call every sort of melancholy an evil spirit: and explains evil spirit by disease,&quot;|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 368}}

{{quote|Not all whom our Lord cured, were said to be possessed with a demon, but only such as were more or less deranged in their minds.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 369}}

{{quote|It is also a fact, which is too much overlooked, that according to the person's degree of insanity, he was supposed to be possessed with the more demons or evil spirits.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 369}}

{{quote|The ancient Jews ascribed to God both the good and the evil things which happened to them... [but] after the Baylonish captivity, the Jews ascribed great and unaccountable evils, such as madness, to the influence of evil spirits [or beings].|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 369}}

{{quote|There is no trace of a belief in the existence of evil spirits even among the Jews, until the Babylonian captivity.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 372}}

{{quote|It is not until the time of the exile, or shortly after it, that we find distinct traces of the doctrine, that there are angles who were once good, but who revolted from God, and are now become wicked themselves, and the authors of the evil in the world.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 372-373}}

{{quote|They led the common people to what was, in effect, a belief in two god - a good and an evil deity; and also to entertain false conceptions of the attributes of the true God|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 373}}

{{quote|They often furnish a real hindrance to moral improvement; for instance; in seeking for the origin of sin in themselves, and endeavoring to stop its sources - instead of becoming acquainted with, and avoiding the external occasions of sin, they laid the whole blame of it upon Satan, and when they had made him guilty, deemed themselves sufficiently justified and exculpated.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 373}}

{{quote|The Jews brought back from their captivity many opinions not found in their sacred books. Their minds were corrupted from their intercourse with the heathen, and when both Jews and heathen were converted to the faith of Christ, many false heathen notions were introduced into the Christian Church, which are not all yet pursed.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 373-374}}

{{quote|Most express are the words of Plato - &quot;every demon is a middle being between God and mortal man&quot;..|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 379}}

{{quote|&quot;God is not approached immediately by man, but all the commerce and intercourse between gods and men, is performed by the mediation of demons.&quot;|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 379}}

{{quote|&quot;The region of the air was supposed by the Pythagoreans to be full of spirits, demons, or heroes, who cause sickness or health to man or beast, and communicate at their pleasure, by means of dreams and other instruments of divination, the knowledge of future events.&quot;|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 390}}

{{quote|Tertullian - &quot;The subtility and fitness of their [demons] make, enables them to enter into both the body and soul of men.&quot;|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 390}}

{{quote|Indeed, all great irregularities in the system of nature, of which raging madness is one, the ancients both heathen and Jews, but especially the latter, were accustomed to attribute to supernatural agency.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 393}}

{{quote|The heathen sent the souls of wicked men to Tartarus after death, and the souls of good men to Elysium... The Jews, and others, sent all good and bad to sheol or hades.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 417}}

{{quote|And pray, what great improvement have modern Christians made on the ancient heathens, for their hell is pretty much the same as theirs.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 418}}

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;The supposed existence of demons is an important concept in many modern religions and occultist traditions. Demons are still feared as a popular superstition, largely due to their alleged power to possess living creatures.

There are indications that demons in popular Hebrew mythology were believed to come from the nether world. Various diseases and ailments were ascribed to them, particularly those affecting the brain and those of internal nature. Examples include the catalepsy, headache, epilepsy, and nightmares.

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;And there appeared another wonder in heaven, &amp; behold a great red Dragon [the Roman heathen Empire] having seven heads &amp; ten horns &amp; seven crowns upon his heads. This Dragon being the old serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan, is that Devil who hath his seat in Pergamus, that is the Greek empire in the reign of the last horn of Daniel’s He Goat.

''The spirits of God of fals Prophets &amp; of Antichrist are'' [in 1 John 4] ''plainly taken not for any substantial Spirits but for ye good or evil dispositions &amp; true or fals perswasions of mens minds;'' &amp; the spirits of all men who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is called in the singular number the spirit of Antichrist, &amp; said to be come into the world as if it were an evil spirit wch was to reign therein &amp; deceive all the followers of Antichrist. And such an evil spirit is the Dragon in the Apocalyps.

By this Devils being cast into the bottomless pit +&amp; shut up, that he should deceive the nations no more for a thousand years you may know that he is the spirit of delusion reigning in the hearts of men &amp; by his being there called the old Serpent you may know that he is that same Serpent wch deceived EFrom ''this figure of putting serpents for spirits &amp; spirits or Daemons for distempers of ye mind, came ye vulgar opinion of ye Jews &amp; other eastern nations that mad men &amp; lunaticks were possessed with evil spirits or Daemons''. Whence Christ seems to have used this language not only as Prophet but also in compliance wth ye Jews way of speaking: so yt when he is said to cast out Devils it cannot be known by this phra those Devils may be nothing but diseases unles it can be proved by the circumstances that they are sp substantial spirits.ve.

If Moses saith: There shall be not be found among you any one that useth divination, or an observer of times, [that is, of days lucky &amp; unlucky,] or an enchanter, or a witch, or a consulter wth familiar spirits, or a wizzard, or a necromancer: for because of these things the Lord thy God doth drive the nations out +from, before thee: ???

===Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit===

{{quote|It has generally been supposed that there are ''two distinct kinds of substance'' in human nature, and they have been distinguished by the terms ''matter'' and ''spirit''. The former of these has been said to be possessed of the property of ''extension'', viz. of length, breadth, and thickness, and also of ''solidity'' or ''impenetrability'', but it is said to be naturally destitute of all powers whatever. The latter has of late been defined to be a substance entirely ''destitute of all extension'', or ''relation to space'', so as to have no propery in common with matter; and therefore to be properly ''immaterial'', but to be possessed of the powers of ''perception, intelligence, and self-motion''.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. i-ii}}

{{quote|It is likewise maintained in this treatise, that the notion of two substances that have no common property and yet are capable of ''intimate connection'' and ''mutual action'', is both absurd and ''modern''.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. iii}}

{{quote|I shall devote as much of my time as possible to the ''pursuit of truth'', and as little as I can help to the mere ''defense of it'', or of ''myself''.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. xix}}

{{quote|That many persons who have rejected a part of it, will see equal reason to reject the whole.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. xxi}}

{{quote|The reason of the conclusion above-mentioned, is simply this, that the powers of sensation or perception, and thought, as belonging to man, have never been found but in conjunction with a certain ''organized system of matter''; and therefore, that those powers necessarily exist in, and depend upon, such a system.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 46}}

{{quote|Moreover, as the faculty of thinking in general ripens, and comes to maturity with the body, it is also observed to decay with it; and if, in some cases, the mental faculties continue vigorous when the body in general is enfeebled, it is evidently because, in those particular cases, the ''brain'' is not much affected by the general cause of weakness.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 47}}

{{quote|Likewise, as the mind is affected in consequence of the affections of the body and brain, so the body is liable to be reciprocally affected by the affections of the mind.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 48}} 

{{quote|Notwithstanding, Mr. Hallet was satisfied that there was no good argument from the light of nature, in favour either of the immateriality or immortality of the soul, he still retained the belief of it on the authority, as he imagined, of ''revelation''. But it will be seen, in a subsequent section, that the scriptures afford no evidence whatever of a thing so contrary to the principles of reason; but that the sacred writers go upon quite different principles, always taking for granted the very thing I am here contending for; and that the notion of the soul being a substance distinct from the body, was originally a part of the system of ''heathenism'', and was from thence introduced into christianity, which has derived the greatest part of its corruptions from this source.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 51}} 

{{quote|Thus, we might conclude, that the body was mortal, from observing that all the separate sense, and limbs, were liable to decay and perish.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 56}} 

{{quote|If the soul be immaterial, and the body material, neither the generation nor the destruction of the body can have any effect with respect to it.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 61}}

{{quote|If the soul be immaterial, and the body material, neither the generation nor the destruction of the body can have any effect with respect to it.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 61}}

{{quote|That a spirit is, strictly speaking, ''indivisible'', which is essential to the modern idea of it, is absolutely incompatible with the notion that is known to have run through almost all the systems of the ancients, derived originally from the East, viz. that all human souls, and all finite intelligences, were originally ''portions of the great soul of the universe''; and though detached from it for a time, are finally to be absorbed into it again;|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 73}}

{{quote|Consequently, according to the strict and only consistent system of immateriality, a spirit is properly ''no where'', and altogether incapable of ''local motion'', though it has an arbitary connection with a body, that is confined to a particular place, and is capable of moving from one place to another.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 76}}

{{quote|How unintelligibly are persons reduced to talk, when they quit the road of common sense, forming their systems not from ''facts'' and ''appearances'', but from ''imagination''.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 78}}

{{quote|The vulgar, who consider ''spirit'' as a ''thin aerial substance'', would be exceedingly puzzled if they were to endeavour to realize the modern idea of a proper ''immaterial being''; since, to them, it would seem to have nothing ''positive'' in its nature, but to be only a ''negation of properties'', though disguised under the positive appellation of ''spirit''. To them it must appear to be the idea of ''nothing at all'', and to be incapable of supporting any properties.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 92}}

{{quote|The essence of the soul, it is said, cannot be matter, because it would then be divisible; but is not everything that is extended divisible?|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 95}}

{{quote|How easy is it to get rid of the embarrassment attending the doctrine of the soul, in every view of it, by admitting, agreeably to all the phenomena, that the power of thinking belongs to the brain of a man, as that of walking to his feet, or that of speaking to his tongue; that, therefore, man, who is one being, is composed of ''one kind of substance'', made of the ''dust of the earth''; that when he dies, he of course, ceases to think; but when his ''sleeping dust'' shall be re-animated at the resurrection, his power of thinking, and his consciousness, will be restored to him?|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 102}}

{{quote|There can be no state of mind to which there is no a corresponding state of the brain... unless [of course] the mind could have sensations and ideas independent of the state of the brain, which every observation proves to be impossible.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 120}}

{{quote|Ideas which have parts... cannot exist in a soul that has no parts|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 131}}

{{quote|The doctrine of a separate soul most evidently embarrasses the true christian system, which takes no sort of notice of it, and is uniform and consistent without it.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 163}}

===Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion===

{{quote|That this doctrine of a resurrection is inconsistent with that of a soul, which survives the body, and retains all of its faculties, not only unimpaired, but improved, (for such is the original and proper doctrine on the subject) is obvious to the slightest consideration. For if such be the condition of the soul, when freed from the clog and obstruction of the body, a resurrection would not only be unnecessary, but even undesirable. The two systems are, therefore, repugnant to each other, and cannot be rationally held together.|Priestley, Joseph|Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion p. 212}}

{{quote|He [Plato] moreover held that &quot;the soul consists of three parts, the first the seat of intelligence, the second of the passions, and the third of appetite,&quot; and he assigned to each its proper place in the human body.|Priestley, Joseph|Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion p. 217}}

===Principles of nature===

{{quote|The human mind is incapable of forming any conception of that which is not material; man is a being whose composition is purely physical, and moral properties or intellect, are the necessary results of organic construction|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. 214-215}}

===World religions===

{{quote|Traditional philosophy boasts of the vast differences in all aspects between animals and men. However, the more we study animals, the more we realize that the similarities between man and animals are far more striking than the differences.|William, Xavier|World Religions KL 884-885}}

{{quote|The early concept of God was that of a ghostly spirit. For the Tennessee, a native tribe in the United States, the word for god, means literally a dead man. Similarly, the term ‘Jehovah’ originally meant the “strong man” or “the warrior.”|William, Xavier|World Religions KL 994-996}}

{{quote|Newborns and infants, on the other hand, are not aware of their aspirations and fears and so cannot project these feelings on to others. Naturally, babies and infants are immune from being possessed or threatened by ghosts, spirits, demons or devils.|William, Xavier|World Religions KL 1212-1213}}

===Wikipedia===

{{quote|Plato (429–347 B.C.E.) argued that, as the body is from the material world, the soul is from the world of ideas and is thus immortal. He believed the soul was temporarily united with the body and would only be separated at death, when it would return to the world of Forms. Since the soul does not exist in time and space, as the body does, it can access universal truths.|Wikipedia|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem Mind Body Problem]}}

===The doctrine of inspiration===

{{quote|Thus, the word &quot;ghost&quot; is by no means confined to the denoting a divine agent; but even, in modern English, it signifies the popular idea of any disembodied human person; and, in scriptural English, we find the expression &quot;yielded up the ghost&quot; as the rendering for a Greek word signifying &quot;died :&quot; and the word &quot;spirit&quot; is by us employed, in manifold senses, to denote courage, animation, alcoholic mixtures, and a multitude of other things.|Macnaught, John|The doctrine of inspiration p. 141}}

===Of the principles and duties of natural religion===

{{quote|'Tis not possible for any Man in his Wits (though never so much addicted to Paradoxes) to believe otherwise, but that the ''Whole'' is greater than the ''Part''; ''That Contradictions cannot both be true; That three and three makes six; That four is more than three''. |Wilkins, John|Of the principles and duties of natural religion p. 60}}

===Racovian Catechism===

{{quote|We ought not in every case to cry out, “I stand in my rank; here I fix my foot, and will not suffer myself to be in the least measure removed from hence.&quot; ...[But rather each one of us ought to be] prepared to give up his opinion when another that is better offers.|Racovian Catechism Preface eiii}}

{{quote|For it is certain that the first man was so created by God as to be endowed with free will; and there was no reason why God should deprive him of it after his fall.|Racovian Catechism p. 325}}

{{quote|I do not deny, however, that, by the habit of sinning, the nature of man is infected with a certain stain, and a very strong disposition to wickedness.|Racovian Catechism p. 326}}

{{quote|For God, after having by his decree excluded from salvation a great, indeed the greatest, part of those to whom the gospel is proclaimed, does nevertheless, by the preaching of the gospel offer salvation to all; and thus acts in one way while he pretends to act in another.|Racovian Catechism p. 333}}

{{quote|It by no means follows from hence that God has decreed absolutely and necessarily concerning each individual man before his birth, and therefore without any regard to the good or evil of his conduct, that one should perish everlastingly, and another be saved...|Racovian Catechism p. 338}}

===Thomas Jefferson===

{{quote|This revelation has made it certain that two and one make three, and that one is not three nor can three be one. We can never be so certain of any prophecy, or the fulfillment of any prophecy, or of any miracle, or the design of any miracle, as we are from the revelation of nature, i. e., Nature’s God, that two and two are equal to four. Miracles or prophecies might frighten us out of our wits; might scare us to death; might induce us to lie, to say that we believe that two and two make five. But we should not believe it. We should know the contrary. Had you and I been forty days with Moses on Mount Sinai, and been admitted to behold the divine Shekinah, and there told that one was three and three one, we might not have had courage to deny it, but we could not have believed it.|John Adams to Thomas Jefferson, Sep 14, 1813}}

{{quote|Ridicule is the only weapon which can be used against unintelligible propositions. Ideas must be distinct before reason can act upon them; and no man ever had a distinct idea of the trinity. It is mere Abracadabra of the mountebanks calling themselves the priests of Jesus.|Thomas Jefferson to Van der Kemp, 1816}}

{{quote|The Presbyterian clergy are loudest, the most intolerant of all sects, the most tyrannical, and ambitious; ready at the word of the lawgiver, if such a word could be now obtained, to put the torch to the pile, and to rekindle in this virgin hemisphere, the flames in which their oracle Calvin consumed the poor Servetus, because he could not find in his Euclid the proposition which has demonstrated that three are one, and one is three, nor subscribe to that of Calvin that magistrates have a right to exterminate all heretics to Calvinistic creed.|Jefferson, letter to William Short, April 13, 1820}}

{{quote|I can never join Calvin in addressing his god. He was indeed an Atheist, which I can never be; or rather his religion was Daemonism. If ever man worshiped a false god, he did. The being described in his 5 points is not the god whom you and I acknowledge and adore, the Creator and benevolent and governor of the world, but a daemon of malignant spirit. It would be more pardonable to believe in no god at all, than to blaspheme him by the atrocious attributes of Calvin.|Jefferson, Letter to John Adams, April 11, 1823}}

===An History of Corruption on Christianity===

{{quote|Theodosius, in whose reign persecution for the sake of religion made greater advances than in any other within this period.. Immediately upon his baptism, which according to the superstitious notions which influenced many persons of that age, he had deferred till his life was in danger by sickness, he published a decree commanding that, &quot;in order that all his subjects should make profession of the same religion which the divine apostle Peter taught the Romans, the doctrine of the Trinity should be embraced by those who would be called catholics; that all others,&quot; whom he says he judged to be mad, &quot;should bear the infamous name of heretics, and that their assemblies should not be called churches, reserving their farther punishment in the first place to the vengeance of heaven&quot;|Priestley, Joseph|An History of Corruption on Christianity pp. 173-174}}

{{quote|Theodosius, who in 448 made a law, by which it was ordered, that all books, the doctrine of which was not conformable to the councils of Nice and Ephsus, and also to the decisions of Cyril, should be destroyed, and the concealers of them put to death.|Priestley, Joseph|An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 177}}

{{quote|Calvin went upon the same plan, persecuting many worthy persons, and even procuring Servetus to be burned alive for writing against the doctrine of the Trinity. He also wrote a treatise in order to prove the lawfulness of putting heretics to death|Priestley, Joseph|An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 192}}

{{quote|The Arian controversy afforded the bishops of Rome several opportunities of extending their power. Athanasius himself engaged the protection of pope Julius; and it was chiefly by the influence of the see of Rome that the trinitiarian doctrine came to be established.|Priestley, Joseph|An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 285}}

{{quote|When that law was made, in the reign of William and Mary, which makes it blasphemy, punishable with confiscation of goods and imprisonment for life, if persisted in, to deny the doctrine of the trinity|Priestley, Joseph|An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 356}}

===Antitrinitarian Biography===

{{quote|What rule of language, it can be correct to say, that the Father is a divine person, the Son is a divine person, and the Holy Ghost is a divine person, and therefore there are three divine persons; and yet when it is asserted, that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, it should at the same time be denied that there are three Gods?|Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 240}}

{{quote|A natural contradiction implies an inconsistency, and impossibility, in the nature of the thing describe, as there described; a numerical contradiction is an error, committed in the summing up of things.|Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 281}}

{{quote|He lays it down, as a principle, that a man, who is obliged to believe a thing, must know what that thing is, before he can believe it. He contends, that a person can neither affirm, nor deny, --- believe, nor disbelieve a proposition, which he does not understand; that it is impossible to assert something of nothing, or of that respecting which we have no idea; and that a man may as well be required to do a thing, when he knows not what it is that he has to do, as to believe, when he cannot comprehend what he is to believe.|Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 287}}

{{quote|It advanceth and so fully proveth this point, ''That Christ and his Apostles did not propound any Articles as necessarily to be believed to make a man a Christian, but this, That Jesus is the Christ, or Messias'', I think it may with great justice be rupted one of the best books that hath been published for at least these sixteen hundred years. The main points for which he contends are, that Christ and his Apostles required no further profession, than that Jesus was the Messiah; that the primitive Christians suffered solely on account of this profession, and not for their faith in any particular doctrines; and that it is antichristian to insist upon anything, as a part of the religion of Jesus, which Jesus himself has not authorized.|Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 314-315}}

{{quote|...the reasons why we affirm, that from eternity there was but One God, the Creator of the universe. If from eternity there have been two or more Gods, either they are united in one and the same essence, or each of them has a distinct essence to himself. But for them to exist in one and the same essence, is impossible; for though they should be one in their denomination of gods, yet as begotten and unbegotten they must be different: seeing what is begotten resembles its parent, whereas the unbegotten is like nothing, being neither made of, nor for anything. But if it should be said that many gods are one, as the hand, foot and eye are but parts of the same body, Socrates will tell you, that what is compounded of, and divisible in parts, is both made and corruptible. But God is uncreated, impassible, and undivisible, therefore not consisting of parts.|Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 325-326}}

{{quote|They [early Unitarians] were known by the name of Anabaptists, because they agreed with that sect on the subject of Baptism; but their opinions were entitled to much more weight, and were the result of more deliberate and profound thought, than those of the German and Dutch Anabaptists.

===Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends===

{{quote|And when I look around me, and observe how the great majority of mankind are blindly following the lead of others, how few there are who think for themselves, how few are willing to test their religious opinions by comparing them with other systems of faith, by bringing them all to “the law and the testimony” of God’s inspired word|Dana, Mary|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends IV}}

{{quote|At this age of the world, a rational religion is certainly needed to counteract the prevalence of infidelity; and nothing but a rational religion will do this. Those in high places may sound the alarm, if they please, and tell us that it is dangerous to use our ''reason'' in matter of religion, but it will all be in vain.|Dana, Mary|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends V}}

{{quote|I conscientiously and firmly reject the doctrine of the Trinity… I received it, as many others do, without thorough investigation, though, I must confess, it has often perplexed me beyond measure. Still I held it, as it seems to me all must do, as a strange mystery, which I must not attempt to comprehend|Dana, Mary|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 2}}

{{quote|From this address [John 20:28] of Thomas, many commentators are of the opinion, that the doctrine of Christ’s divine nature may be established, and conceive that the sentence, when filled up, would be thus: ‘I am not faithless; I doubt no longer; thou art my Lord and my God.’ But, on the contrary, others justly observe, that Thomas used the term God in the sense in which it is applied to kings and judges, who were considered as representatives of Deity, and preeminently to the Messiah.|Dana, Mary|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 22}}

{{quote|Again, he says, that they who style themselves orthodox “constantly assert, that the will, power and wisdom of the whole Trinity is one and the same; and that what one wills, does, and knows, they all will do and know, by virtue of this unity of essence.” Again, “that where the numerical essence is one and the same, the will and actions of that essence must be one and the same. And where the will and actions are numerically distinct and diverse, there the individual essence must also be distinct and different. And this Damascen declares to be the doctrine of the holy Fathers. Hence, it demonstratively follows, that of the essence of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, be numerically one and the same, the will and all the other actions of these three, must be numerically one and the same; so that, what the Father wills and does, the Son and Holy Ghost must will and do also… If the three persons in the Trinity have one mind and will, how could Christ say he came not to do his own will, but the will of him that sent him? “I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which sent me.”|Dana, Mary|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 30}}

{{quote|Bear in mind also that the term worship… was used in the early ages of the Church with as great latitude as the term God, and did no more ''always'' mean ''supreme'' homage than the term God ''always'' meant the ''supreme'' Being. Nebuchadnezzar “fell upon his face and ''worshipped'' Daniel,” but not as the supreme God; and the eastern sages worshipped the infant Jesus, but not as the supreme God.|Dana, Mary|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 33}}

{{quote|First, that Watts did not believe the Trinity, as usually understood, to be ‘plainly taught in any single text;’ secondly, that in his mind it was not so expressed in the Scriptures at large as to be intelligible to ‘reason and conscience;’ and thirdly, that the ‘strange and perplexing notion of three real persons going to make up one true God,’ is not a ‘necessary and important part of the Christian doctrine,’ whatever may be thought of its reality.|Dana, Mary|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 54-55}}

{{quote|Namely that the early Fathers did not believe that the Trinity was taught in Scriptures, and that those who believed in and contended for this doctrine themselves, did not receive it as it is received at the present day.|Dana, Mary|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 54-59}}

{{quote|Human nature – nature as it exists in the bosom of an infant – is nothing else but capability; capability of good as well as evil, though more likely from its exposures, to be evil than good.|Dana, Mary|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 66}}

{{quote|Those who receive the doctrine of the Trinity are the persons who are depending upon human reason. It appears to me they fall into two strange and opposite errors. They first construct the doctrine upon inference and human reason, and then they prostrate reason to receive it.|Dana, Mary|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 78}}

{{quote|But when all you say amounts to this, we are right, and you are wrong – you are blind, but we can see; I acknowledge that I am not in a fair way to be convinced.|Dana, Mary|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 79}}

{{quote|In the New Testament I constantly find that men where commanded to believe that the Messiah was the Son of God; but in the present day a very different faith is required of us. Instead of saying, “I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God,” men are required to say, “I believe that thou art the living God himself.”|Dana, Mary|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 92}}

{{quote|I not long ago heard two orthodox divines of the Calvinistic school congratulating themselves upon the perfection of their system, remarking that they prized it because all the parts of it &quot;dovetailed&quot; together so nicely. Yes, Sir, it is certain they do dovetail in a beautiful manner, but it is only as a system of human invention that they do so; they certainly do not harmonize with human reason, nor, it is plain to me, with Scripture; certainly not with the character of God as revealed to us in the Bible.|Dana, Mary|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 108}}

===Principles of nature===

{{quote|If the assertion be made, that one is equal to three, and that three are no more than one, all numerical distinction is totally destroyed, and man consents to become a fool upon the plainest points. Trinitarian declarations are direct contradictions to each other; the part is as great as the whole, and the whole is no greater than the part; three infinites put together make only one, and the destruction of two of them does not diminish the mass of existence or perfection.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 17-18}}

{{quote|This doctrine of the Trinity, Christianity has borrowed from the ancient heathen ideas, and the church has incorporated it for the purposes of mystery and ecclesiastical imposition. It was found among the reveries of Plato, and being transferred to the followers of Jesus, it has appeared under the modification, and with the names of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Thus modified, it became the foundation of a cruel and ferocious dogma, that external damnation should be the portion of him who called in question this holy mystery.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 18}}

===Reasons for not believing the doctrines of the Trinitarians===

{{quote|Beings, whose existence is dependent on the will of another, cannot be equal in power to the being on whom they depend.|Andrews, Norton|Reasons for not believing the doctrines of the Trinitarians p. 8}}

===The Age of Reason===

{{quote|As to the Christian system of faith, it appears to me as a species of atheism - a sort of religious denial of God. It professes to believe in a man rather than in God. It is a compound made up chiefly of manism with but little deism.|Paine, Thomas|The age of reason p. 29}}

===World Religions===

{{quote|If Jesus is God, any god can do what he did and forgive his tormentors and so Jesus does not deserve any credit for what he did. On the other hand, if he is an ordinary human being like us with our own frailties and shortcomings, then he deserves to be admired and emulated. By making him a God, the vested interests have taken the shine off the glory of his humanity.|William, Xavier|World Religions KL 7831-7833}}

===Other Places on the Internet===

{{quote|The Christian doctrine of the trinity -- Father, Son, and Holy Ghost -- was not formalized until the 4th or 5th century C. E.

Even in early Christianity, this trinity had a female member, the Holy Ghost.|[http://www.northernway.org/twm/mary/trinity.html Mary and the Trinity]}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9183">The doctrine of ''angels'' has been long embedded in Christian theology yet there is little that is known about these creatures who are thought to be the servants of God. This lack of knowledge has been the cause of much ''speculation'' about them. 

==Causes for Doubt==

# Why does God need angels to do his bidding?
# If human agents of God exist then what necessity is there for supernatural agents of God to exist?
# How can an angel as an immaterial spirit being interact with the material world?

==Existence==

The creation of angels is completely lacking from the scriptures.

{{quote|Of note is that the Bible describes the function of angels as 'messengers' and does not indicate when the creation of angels occurred.|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel Angel]|Wikipedia}}

The word angel simply means messenger and should not be ''inferred'' to mean a supernatural creature.

{{quote|Again, the word 'angel' comes from the old Greek noun angelos which meant 'a messenger' or 'a message-bearer'. The related verb angellô meant 'to bear a message to someone'. The nouns angelia and angelma meant 'a report', 'a message', 'tidings', 'news'.|[http://www.biblepages.net/hd07.htm What does the Bible say about angels?]}}

The most that can be ''inferred'' from the word &quot;angel&quot; is a messenger. It could equally be used to infer a human messenger as it could to infer a supernatural messenger. Even if the passage refers to the divinity of the messenger, it could still be interpreted as a human messenger who is divine because he does the works of God.

{{quote|Young's literal translation properly translates the Greek word used for angel as 'messenger'. In the original Greek, There is no distinction between the word used for a heavenly being or a earthly being who is sent as a messenger.&lt;ref&gt;LightHouse Prophecy. [http://www.lighthouseprophecy.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=410 The Day of His Power]&lt;/ref&gt;|The Day of His Power|LightHouse Prophecy}}

==Appearance==

Everyone believes angels have wings but the scriptures never so describes them as having such.

{{quote|However, while cherubim and seraphim have wings in the Bible, no angel is mentioned as having wings|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel Angel]|Wikipedia}}

Angels, as immaterial spirit beings, are impossible for the material physical eye to see.

{{quotation|When we see an entity, it is because photons (light) are emitted by that entity, or bounce off the entity - actually, are absorbed and then emitted by the entity - and then these photons enter our eye, and stimulate an electrical signal to our brain. ''An entity which is not physical to the extent that it can bounce or emit photons cannot be physically seen.''

... an angel can also be a non-physical being, and therefore presumably if an angel existed, it would not exist in a physical sense. According to these interpretations, it would not have physical meaning to state that the angel walked somewhere or picked up something, or said something, since all these imply a physical structure existing in spacetime. Similarly, the angel if it were not physical - could not be said to emit or bounce off photons, and therefore it could not be said with physical meaning that the angel could be ‘seen’. And, since it cannot be seen or measured or felt by any physical means, it would perhaps be meaningless to say that the angel was there - in any physical sense of ‘being’ - but simply could not be seen.

Therefore if someone were to ‘see’ an angel, it would presumably be due to an image which was formed directly in their minds by some spiritual agency, rather than by physical means. This would mean that the person would see the angel, but this vision of the angel would be an internal reality, and would not correspond to a physical entity outside the viewer - there would not be an angel ‘out there’.

Of course it would be possible for God to create a physical being and send it to someone, who would then see it. This however would be a physical being and not an angel, if an angel is defined to be a spiritual being. If however ‘angel’ means simply ‘messenger of God’, then it would be possible to see physical angels of course.|[https://files.nyu.edu/air1/public/Did%20the%20Ass%20Really%20Talk.html Divine Encounters in the Torah: Rambam vs. Ramban]}}

==Rank==

That there exists different angels with various ranks in the heavens is based on the word ''archangel''.

{{quote|The Greek word in question, archangelos, simply meant 'chief messenger', and as we all know, it is Jesus who is God’s Chief Messenger. 1 Thessalonians 4:16 clearly refers to Jesus, and probably Jude 9 as well.|[http://www.biblepages.net/hd07.htm What does the Bible say about angels?]}}

{{quote|But the simple word ''angel'' is nevertheless expressive of ''office'', and does not therefore necessarily signify a superhuman being. The angels of the seven churches of Asia mentioned in the Book of Revelation, were the ''ministers'' of those churches, and consequently men in the flesh.|Moore, Asher|Universalism, the doctrine of the Bible p. 41}}

That there exists guardians angels for each individual is based on the beliefs of the Zoroastrians which were adopted by the Jews while in captivity in Babylon. 

{{quote|In Zoroastrianism there are different angel-like figures. For example, each person has one guardian angel, called Fravashi. They patronize human beings and other creatures, and also manifest God’s energy.|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel Angel]|Wikipedia}}

Guardian angels were part of the belief system of the Jews by the time of Jesus.

{{quote|Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.|Matthew 18:10 KJV}}

==Judaism==

Similar to how the ''spirit of anger'' does not refer to a spirit but simply the disposition of the person, Maimondies, a 12th century Jewish rabbi, believed that angels do not refer to supernatural beings, but rather to various laws of nature.

{{quote|On the other end of the philosophical spectrum is the view of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon, better known as Maimonides. He had a neo-Aristotelian interpretation of the Bible. Maimonides writes that to the wise man, one sees that what the Bible and Talmud refer to as &quot;angels&quot; are actually allusions to the various laws of nature; they are the principles by which the physical universe operates.|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherub Cherub]|Wikipedia}}

{{quote|For all forces are angels! How blind, how perniciously blind are the naive?! If you told someone who purports to be a sage of Israel that the Deity sends an angel who enters a woman's womb and there forms an embryo, he would think this a miracle and accept it as a mark of the majesty and power of the Deity, despite the fact that he believes an angel to be a body of fire one third the size of the entire world. All this, he thinks, is possible for God. But if you tell him that God placed in the sperm the power of forming and demarcating these organs, and that this is the angel, or that all forms are produced by the Active Intellect; that here is the angel, the &quot;vice-regent of the world&quot; constantly mentioned by the sages, then he will recoil|Maimonides. Guide for the Perplexed II:4}}

{{quote|For he {the naive person} does not understand that the true majesty and power are in the bringing into being of forces which are active in a thing although they cannot be perceived by the senses....Thus the Sages reveal to the aware that the imaginative faculty is also called an angel; and the mind is called a cherub. How beautiful this will appear to the sophisticated mind, and how disturbing to the primitive.|Maimonides. Guide for the Perplexed II:6}}

{{quote|[Furthermore] Maimonides says.. that the figures of the cherubaim were placed in the sanctuary only to preserve among the people the belief in angels, there being two in order that the people might not be led to believe that they were the image of God.|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherub Cherub]|Wikipedia}}

Because of the teachings of Maimonides there are now certain sects of Judaism that view angels differently.

{{quote|The existences of angels is generally widely contested within traditional rabbinic Judaism; there is, however, a wide range of views on what angels actually are, and how literally one should interpret biblical passages associated with them. Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism generally either drop references to angels or interpret them metaphorically.|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherub Cherub]|Wikipedia}}

==Christianity==

In Christianity, it is thought that the angels of light are in the heavens and/or upon the earth doing battle with the angels of darkness. It seems strange for two opposing factions of angels to be fighting in a battle in which neither side can be &quot;physically&quot; harmed.

The human race has continued to demand more and more of itself. Our productivity has increased leaps and bounds from what it was only a few hundred years ago. 

Evolution appears to be moving toward ever increasing complexities. Humanity itself may simply be one step in the chain of evolutionary complexity. That is not to dismiss humanity, as that single step may be one of the most important steps. The complexities of our universe have brought us forth, it is therefore only natural that our complexities should bring forth another even more complex and even more intelligent that ourselves. In other words, it is very possible that humanity, the highest known natural complexity, should become the father to the next chain of evolutionary complexity, the first chain of selective complexity.

As the population continues to grow, and with it demand for more product, the manufacturing sector will not be able to meet the demand by relying on human labor.

==Negativity==

Individuals who suffer from anxiety disorders generally have a hyper-awareness of their environment. They are always scanning for possible threats which can be either external threats or internal threats.

{{quote|Anxious people are very smart at plotting out possible bad outcomes.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 324}}

{{quote|Elements of modern research lend support to Northfield's warning: anxious people have a pathological tendency to focus their attention inward, on themselves, in a way that suggests a book-length dwelling on one's own anxiety is hardly the best way to escape it.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 24}}

{{quote|David Barlow, one of the preeminent researchers in the field, notes that pathological, negative self-focus &quot;seems to be an integral part of the cognitive-affective structure of anxiety...&quot;|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 24}}

If the variables in the external environment become too uncontrollable to possibly safeguard against, attention can then switch to the internal environment of the patient where they at least feel they have some control.

{{quote|Anxiety disorder patients tend both to feel like they don't have much control over their lives and to be afraid of losing control of their bodies or their minds.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 87}}

==Sleep==
Sleep deprivation appears closely associated with anxiety. Many people who have anxiety also report problems sleeping. It is no wonder then that sleep deprivation adversely affects the brain and cognitive functions. Stress and sleep deprivation can feed off of each other to produce a monster that holds the mind in captivity.

{{quote|I'd imagine that the lack of sleep and the extreme amounts of mental stress had done a physical number on my body. Not only was I not sleeping, I was so stressed that I wasn't even getting hungry.|Ryckert, Dan|Anxiety as an Ally p. 14}}

{{quote|Minutes seemed like hours as I tried to quiet my mind long enough to fall asleep.|Ryckert, Dan|Anxiety as an Ally p. 80}}

==Physiology==

The notion of the mind and body being separate from one another has existed a long time. It was even once thought that all our mind's thoughts emanated from one a great celestial mind. Modern science and biology has dispelled these ancient philosophies and we now know that the organ in our body called the ''brain'' is responsible for our thinking; and that when the brain is damaged so are our abilities to think. 

{{quote|Physical states create psychic ones and not vice-versa.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 54}}

{{quote|My anxiety is a reminder that I am governed by my physiology - that what happens in the body may do more to determine what happens in the mind than the other way around. Though thinkers from Aristole to William James to the researchers who publish today in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine have recognized this fact, it runs counter to the one of the basic Platonic-Cartesian tenets of Western thought - the idea that who we are, the way we think and perceive, is a product of our disembodied souls or intellects.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 30}}

{{quote|The bases of mental illness are chemical changes in the brain... There's no longer any justification for the distinction... between mind and body or mental and physical illness. Mental illnesses are physical illnesses.|Satcher, David|U.S. Surgeon General 1999}}

The part of the brain that is associated with anxiety is the area that is activated during an emotional fear response called the amygdala.

{{quote|For instance, acute anxiety generally appears on fMRI scans as ''hyperactivity in the amygdala'', that tiny almond-shaped structure located deep in the medial temporal lobes near the base of the skull. Reductions in anxiety are associated with ''diminished activity in the amygdala'' and with heightened activity in the frontal cortex.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 41}}

==Treatment==

To reduce anxiety, the autonomic &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; response must be reprogrammed. Modern treatment generally involves a combination of methods, both pharmacological and behavioral.

{{quote|One was accepting that this would be a long fight with no magic solution. The other was discovering the importance of opening up about what I was going through.|Ryckert, Dan|Anxiety as an Ally p. 49}}

===Exposure Therapy===

In the 1693 the philosopher John Locke described what is now known as exposure therapy in his book on education.

{{quote|Your child shrieks, and runs away at the sight of a frog; let another catch it and lay it down a good distance from him; at first accustom him to look upon it, and see it leap without emotion; then to touch it lightly when it is held fast in another's hand; and so on till he can come to handle it as confidently as a butterfly, or a sparrow. By the same way any other vain terror may be removed if care be taken, that you go not too fast, and push not the child on to a new degree of assurance, till he be thoroughly confirm'd in the former. And thus the young soldier is to be trained on to the warfare of life.|Locke, John|Some thoughts on education p. 176}}

{{quote|The logic of this approach - which has lately been undergirded by neuroscience research - is that extended exposure to the object of fear, under the guidence of a therapist, makes the object less frightening.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 68}}

===Meditation===

The ''Law of Noncontradiction'' states that &quot;contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time&quot;. It is the logical basis for the the rationale behind Joseph Wolpe's work on behavioral modification.

{{quote|Wolpe’s rationale was that you cannot be both relaxed and anxious at the same time.|Wikipedia|[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Wolpe Joseph Wolpe]}}

Techniques which involve deep, slow and controlled breathing (''diaphragmatic breathing'' &lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragmatic_breathing Diaphramatic breathing]&lt;/ref&gt;) are often used to help calm the body and change it from a state of anxiousness to one of relaxation. In the same manner, meditation can help the mind refocus its thoughts off of its object of fear and on to an object of security.

{{quote|The biomedical view, for its part, increasingly recognizes the power of things like meditation and traditional talk therapy to render concrete structural changes in brain physiology that are every bit as &quot;real&quot; as the changes wrought by pills or electroshock therapy.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 53}}

{{quote|Meditation led to decreased density of the amygdala, a physical change that was correlated with subjects' self-reported stress levels - as their amygdalae got less dense, the subjects felt less stressed.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 54}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39347">The doctrine of baptism is essentially the belief that in order to be saved you must be baptized. Adherents to the doctrine usually prescribe a particular mode or method of being baptized and advertise it as the one true baptism; whereby if one is not baptized in that one particular way, they are not saved.

==Causes for Doubt==

# What special power is in the water that makes it the determining factor whereby we are saved?
# Why didn't the apostles themselves ever get baptized with water?
# Why didn't Christ baptize with water any himself?
# Did Christ come to institute a religious rite?

==Background==

''Ritual washings'' were frequently practiced by the Jews to purify the body in accordance with Mosaic law. 

{{quote|The ordinances of purification in the Levitical law relate especially to the removal of legal uncleanness connected with child birth, death, and other pollutions.|Primitve Culture p. 440}}

These ritual washings were common place by the time of John the Baptist who first used them as a call to reformation &lt;ref&gt;Luke 3:3&lt;/ref&gt;. 

{{quote|... John, that was called the Baptist: for Herod slew him, who was a good man, and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both as to righteousness towards one another, and piety towards God, and so to come to baptism; for that the washing [with water] would be acceptable to him, if they made use of it, not in order to the putting away [or the remission] of some sins [only], but ''for the purification of the body''; supposing still that the soul was thoroughly purified beforehand by righteousness.|Flavius Josephus|Jewish Antiqities 18. 5. 2.}}

After the death of Christ, the use of ritual washings as a call to reformation evolved into the ''initiation rite'' of baptism and were further ''mystified''.

{{quote|Water baptism seems not to have been insisted upon at first but in the second century greater importance appears to have been attached to it... [and] about the beginning of the third century we find water baptism first called a sacrament|J. H. Moon|Water baptism p. 54-55}}

{{quote|...both the positive institutions of Christianity, baptism and the Lord's supper, were converted into mysteries|Priestley, Joseph|An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 87}}

{{quote|Initiation is a rite of passage marking entrance or acceptance into a group or society... Examples of initiation ceremonies might include Hindu diksha, ''Christian baptism'' or confirmation, Jewish bar or bat mitzvah, acceptance into a fraternal organization, secret society or religious order, or graduation from school or recruit training.|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation Initiation]|Wikipedia}}

Later groups used other monastic religious rites along with baptism to ensure that the initiate was &quot;prepared&quot;; this had the net effect making the initiation more severe.

{{quote|But before the baptism let the baptizer fast, and the baptized, and whoever else can; but you shall order the baptized to fast one or two days before.|Didache 7:4}}

{{quote|Laboratory experiments in psychology have shown that severe initiations produce cognitive dissonance. Dissonance is then thought to produce feelings of strong group attraction among initiates after the experience, because they want to justify the effort used. Rewards during initiations have important consequences in that initiates who feel more rewarded express stronger group identity. As well as group attraction, initiations can also produce conformity among new members. Psychology experiments have also shown that initiations increase feelings of affiliation.|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation Initiation]|Wikipedia}}

==First Arguments==

'''Following Christ'''

As justification for the continued use of water baptism it is not uncommon to hear the ''follow Christ'' argument. Here stated,

* Jesus Christ was baptized in water &lt;ref&gt;Matthew 3:13&lt;/ref&gt;
* We should follow Christ's example &lt;ref&gt;1 Peter 2:21&lt;/ref&gt;
* Therefore we should be baptized in water

It would seem on the surface to be a sound argument however that same argument could be applied to everything that Jesus did during his lifetime and still be valid. In other words, the idea that we should follow Christ in ''everything'', is very vague and not technically possible. For example, Christ migrated from Egypt to Israel during his lifetime, should we not then all follow his example and all move to Israel? If I wanted to promote my own doctrine called ''the doctrine of migration to Israel'', I could use this same argument and it would be valid - that because Christ did it, ipso-facto it is now required by all of us to do. Christ followed all the Mosaic laws, shall we follow them all too?

'''Precautionary Approach'''

Many times the prevailing mentality about baptism is a ''better safe than sorry one''; that is, it is better to be safe and get baptized then to remain unbaptized and to be damned. Such an approach to problem solving utilizes the  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle precautionary principle]: defined as &quot;''caution practised in the context of uncertainty''&quot;. When the mind chooses to take a precautionary action, it is based on uncertainty rather than on any truth. In other words, a precautionary approach relieves the mind of the believer from having to gain a deeper understanding about the problem at hand.

==The Command==

Another argument often made in favor of water baptism is that Jesus commanded his apostles to water baptize.

===Matthew 28:19===

The most prominent command to go forth and baptize is found in what is referred to as ''the great commission'':

{{quote|Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.|Matthew 28:19-20 NKJV}}

However, the authenticity of Matthew 28:19 is disputed.

{{quote|In his Literal Translation of the Bible, Dr. Robert Young placed the Trinitarian ''names'' of Matthew 28:19 in parentheses, thus indicating the words to be of doubtful authenticity.|[http://www.israelofgod.org/Constantine.htm Constantine wrote Matthew 28:19 in your bible]}}

{{quote|It is the central piece of evidence for the traditional view of the institution of baptism by Christ. If it were undisputed, this would, of course, be decisive, but its trustworthiness is impugned on the grounds of ''textual criticism, literary criticism, and historical criticism''.|[http://www.godglorified.com/Kirsopp%20Lake.htm Encyclopedia of Religion And Ethics 1964 p. 380]}}

'''Textual criticism'''

Matthew 28:19 was quoted over 21 times in the writings of an early church father named Eusebius which point to a text that omitted the baptismal formula and the command to baptize. Interestingly enough, it wasn't until after the First Council of Nicaea, in which the doctrine of the [[trinity]] was first promulgated, that Eusebius' writings quoted Matthew 28:19 more closely inline with the traditional wording.

'''Literary criticism'''

No other gospel quotes Jesus as commanding baptism in the trinitarian formula as Matthew 28:19 does. Had the wording of the commission been of great importance and necessary for salvation then one would imagine it would have been preserved in more than one gospel.  

'''Historical criticism'''

All of the baptisms in the book of Acts where a name was explicitly mentioned were in the name of Jesus Christ and not in the triune names commanded by Matthew 28:19.

{{quote|But we may take notice, that neither this, nor water baptism, was &quot;into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.&quot; No there is not one instance of this form of words in all the Bible, in the use of water.|Scott, John| [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24996588M/The_baptism_of_Christ_a_gospel_ordinance The baptism of Christ, a gospel ordinance being altogether inward and spiritual] p. 127}}

{{quote|Scholars generally agree that 9:5, which speaks of baptism &quot;in the name of the Lord,&quot; represents an earlier tradition that was gradually replaced by a trinity of names.|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didache Didache]|Wikipedia}}

Had Matthew 28:19 been a command given by Jesus to his apostles then it would stand in judgment against them as they never obeyed it by baptizing in the manner prescribed.

{{quote|Although Jesus was baptized by John, he makes little mention of it, and never requires it of his disciples. He sends forth the Twelve without including it in the instructions given to them. The one passage which commands the eleven disciples to go forth and baptize in all nations &quot;in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&quot; betrays its later origin by using the language of the next century. Certainly those who maintain that this is a genuine command of the Master and that no baptism is valid without this Trinitarian formula, must be prepared to accept the logical conclusion of their premise, -- namely that few if any of the Apostolic baptismal services were valid.|Reccord, P. Augustus. Baptism and the Lord's Supper p. 5}}

===Mark 16:16===

Beyond Matthew 28:19 the only other place in the entire scriptures where Jesus is said to give a command to baptize is in Mark 16:16:

{{quote|He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.|Mark 16:16}}

However, the oldest ancient manuscripts do not have anything after Mark 16:8 and of the manuscripts that do there are at least 5 different known endings &lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_16#Versions Mark 16 - Versions]&lt;/ref&gt;. It probable that the end of Mark 16 is a later interpolation taken from Matthew 28 of what might have been written.

===Luke 24:47===

Given that both Matthew 28:19 and Mark 16:16 are of a questionable or later authenticity, it leaves the book of Luke as the remaining source about what Jesus might have said to his disciples during this time.

{{quote|and he said to them -- &quot;Thus it hath been written, and thus it was behoving the Christ to suffer, and to rise out of the dead the third day, and ''reformation and remission of sins to be proclaimed in his name to all the nations'', beginning from Jerusalem&quot;|Luke 24:46-67 YLT}}

Luke does not mention anything regarding baptism, but he does mention simply the proclamation of the gospel in the name of Jesus to all the nations. If we take that along with what Eusebius originally believed Matthew 28:19 to be, we can come to a proper conclusion about what Jesus said.

{{quote|Go ye, and make disciples of all nations in my name|The Church History of Eusebius, Book III, Chapter V}}

These two statements when considered together are good evidence that the words of Jesus were simply to the spreading of the gospel. To become a disciple and to be water baptized may have been viewed synonymously by parts of the early church, but they do not have the same meaning nor does one particularly necessitate the other.

{{quote|When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John (although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples)|John 4:1-2 ASV}}

{{quote|And did not Jesus himself wholly avoid baptizing any in water, on purpose that it might plainly appear that there is another?|Scott, John| [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24996588M/The_baptism_of_Christ_a_gospel_ordinance The baptism of Christ, a gospel ordinance being altogether inward and spiritual] p. 137}}

The scriptures don't furnish us with any record of Jesus having water baptized anyone nor do they furnish us with the water baptisms of the disciples. Had water baptism been hierarchical in nature and of a saving power then the scriptures should have included such records. Not surprisingly, water baptism is absent from Jesus' own mission statement which mentions only preaching. 

{{quote|and he saith to them, &quot;We may go to the next towns, that there also I may preach, for for this I came forth.&quot;|Mark 1:38 YLT}}

In real world terms, preaching is necessary for spreading the gospel and making disciples, water baptism is not. The ''great commission'' given by Jesus was not a command to institute a new religious rite but was a command to spread the word. 

{{quote|There is a multitude of rites of the Old Testament, but we believe in every instance that the ''person'', the ''time'', and the ''mode'', are rigorously defined. Whatever be the rite in question, it is stipulated who is to perform it, who is to be the subject, at what time, in what place, and with what attendant circumstances, it is to be observed... Do we ever find, during the economy of the Old Testament, that men fell into endless discussions about the time, place, and manner of any one of the rites? Is it to be supposed that the same Spirit who laid off the ordinances in such a manner in the one dispensation as to prevent mistakes, would leave them thus vague and indefinite in the other?|Wishart's theological essays|MacNair. Robert, Christian Baptism, Spiritual not Ritual, pp. 264-265}}

==Acts==

The book of Acts describes several instances where converts were baptized and these are often used as arguments for the continued use of water baptism. It should be noted however that not all instances specify the substance that the convert was baptized in. The traditional view of baptism has been to ''imply water'' to these instances even when it isn't explicitly stated. If we broadly look at baptism in Acts, what can be clearly seen is a transformation from a baptism of water to a baptism of spirit and from a baptism meant only for the Jews to a baptism meant for the entire world. 

The baptism of John gradually decreases and the baptism of Christ gradually increases.

{{quote|He must increase, but I must decrease.|John 3:30 NKJV}}

===Opening===

The four gospels begin with the baptism of John; conversely, the book of Acts begins with the baptism of Christ in which his apostles are commanded not to depart from Jerusalem but to wait to ''be baptized with the Holy Spirit'' &lt;ref&gt;Acts 1:5 YLT&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{quote|And being assembled together with them, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, [saith he,] &quot;Ye did hear of me; because John, indeed, baptized with water, and ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit -- after not many days.&quot;|Acts 1:4-5 YLT}}

===Peter===

After the apostles receive the gift of the holy spirit, Peter preaches for the first time to his fellow Jews in Jerusalem that they might also receive the gift of the holy spirit.

{{quote|and Peter said unto them, &quot;Reform, and be baptized each of you on the name of Jesus Christ, to remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, for to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all those afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.&quot;|Acts 2:38 YLT}}

The next time Peter is seen preaching he mentions nothing about baptism.

{{quote|Reform ye, therefore, and turn back, for your sins being blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord|Acts 3:19 YLT}}

This could indicate that Peter meant for them to be baptized but that the scriptures don't explicitly state it or that it wasn't explicitly stated in the scriptures because the point of Peter's messages weren't to be water baptized. 

To reconcile both messages together,

{{quote|It is also possible to take the clause &quot;and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ&quot; as parenthetical. Support for that interpretation comes from that fact that 'repent' and 'your' are plural, while 'be baptized' is singular, thus setting it off from the rest of the sentence. If that interpretation is correct, the verse would read &quot;Repent (and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ) for the forgiveness of your sins.&quot; Forgiveness is thus connected with repentance, not baptism, in keeping with the consistent teaching of the New Testament|[http://www.gty.org/resources/questions/qa79 Is Baptism Necessary for Salvation]}}

{{quote|Second, the immediate context of the verse shows that only repentant faith is needed to gain divine forgiveness. Earlier in his message, Peter quoted from Joel (Acts 2:16-20) and concluded with that Old Testament prophet's evangelistic appeal: &quot;And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved&quot; (v. 21). In the Old Testament period, people became saved by calling upon Jehovah-God. They acknowledged their sinful need, believed that only God could deliver them, and placed their trust in Him. They did not submit to water baptism. If Peter meant that baptism was essential to salvation, then why did he quote from Joel? The reference would be irrelevant.
&lt;br/&gt;
Third, the greater context of the Book of Acts reveals that only repentant faith is the basis of securing divine forgiveness. Later, in his sermon at Solomon's Porch within the Temple, Peter appealed to the crowd; &quot;Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out&quot; (Acts 3:19). There is no mention of water baptism here as a requirement for the removal of sins.|[http://www.backtothebible.org/index.php/Q-Is-water-baptism-necessary-for-salvation-in-Christ.html Is Water Baptism Necessary for Salvation in Christ]}}

The consequences of interpreting salvation in such a formulaic manner is that the gift of the holy spirit then becomes conditional upon being water baptized. Such a conclusion is contradictory to later events, such as those concerning the household of Cornelius, which show that water baptism is not conditional to receiving the gift of the holy spirit. To view water baptism as a condition upon which a man is saved is to make the work of God subservient to the work of men.

{{quote|In those dark ages the clergy affected to keep the people in ignorance, and in a state of dependence upon themselves, and wished to make them think that the whole business of reconciling men to God was in their hands.|Priestley, Joseph|An History of the Corruptions on Christianity p. 119}}

===Cornelius===

In Acts 10:48, Peter gives an order that all of Cornelius' house be baptized in water.

{{quote|While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, &quot;Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?&quot; And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.|Acts 10:44-48 KJV}}

Before Peter gave the order to have them water baptized he appealed to the reason of the men who journeyed with him when he said, &quot;Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized...?&quot; In other words, Peter was unsure about whether or not Cornelius' household should be water baptized. Often it is inferred that Peter knew what should have been done in that instance and that his question was only rhetorical, however there is nothing to lead us to believe that was the case. It is possible that Peter had Cornelius and his household baptized in water because he still believed them to be unclean.

What can be taken away from these events was what Peter summarized to those who were in Judea; namely that ''God had also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life'' and that came through the ''gift'' and not the water. 

{{quote|Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. If therefore God gave them the same ''gift'' as He gave us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God? When they heard these things they became silent; and they glorified God, saying, &quot;''Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life.''&quot;|Acts 11:16}}

===Philip===

In Acts 8:27-39 Philip meets an Ethiopian who had just come to Jerusalem to worship:

{{quote|Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?... And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.|Acts 8:35-38 KJV}}

When Philip went up to the Ethiopian it was not with the intention to water baptism him but to shared with him the good news about Jesus. In fact, the request to be water baptized was that of the Ethiopian who asked Philip, &quot;See, here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized?&quot; That the Ethiopian had just come from Jerusalem accounts for why he thought he needed to be water baptized.

===Paul===

In Acts 19, Paul comes across some disciples who had never heard there was a holy spirit.

{{quote|And it came to pass, in Apollos' being in Corinth, Paul having gone through the upper parts, came to Ephesus, and having found certain disciples, he said unto them, &quot;The Holy Spirit did ye receive -- having believed?&quot; and they said unto him, &quot;But we did not even hear whether there is any Holy Spirit;&quot; and he said unto them, &quot;To what, then, were ye baptized?&quot; and they said, &quot;To John's baptism.&quot; And Paul said, &quot;John, indeed, did baptize with a baptism of reformation, saying to the people that in him who is coming after him they should believe -- that is, in the Christ -- Jesus;&quot; and they, having heard, were baptized -- to the name of the Lord Jesus, and Paul having laid on them [his] hands, the Holy Spirit came upon them, they were speaking also with tongues, and prophesying, and all the men were, as it were, twelve.|Acts 19:1-7 YLT}}

The passage is clear that to be baptized in the name of the Lord was simply to believe on the Christ. Nothing is mentioned about the usage of water or of Paul performing an act on these men other then telling them about Jesus and laying his hands on them.

{{quote|Calvin views the words, &quot;They were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus,&quot; as pointing to the baptism of the Spirit, and then adds, 'Nor is this interpretation inconsistent with what is stated afterwards, that &quot;when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them.&quot; For Luke does not rate two different things, but follows a mode of narration familiar to the Hebrews, who first propose a subject generally, and then unfold it in more details.|MacNair, Robert|Christian Baptism, Spiritual not Ritual p. 93}}

It should come then as no surprise when Paul later wrote that Christ did not send him to baptize; similarly Christ did not send his twelve apostles to their cities to baptize either -- but only to teach and preach&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 11:1&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{quote|For Christ did not send me to baptize, but -- to proclaim good news;|1 Corinthians 1:17 YLT}}

==Superstitions==

There were a number of superstitions that arose regarding baptism.

===Use of a Name===

In the course of the early church when the people saw the apostles perform wonderful acts in the name of Jesus, it was ''supposed'' that there existed a ''sanctifying virtue'' in the name being used. In other words, the acts being done were attributed to the words being said rather than to the actual performer of those works; as if the apostles were magicians casting spells.

The apostles did works ''in the name of Jesus'' but did not always use the the words &quot;in the name of Jesus&quot; when done. To do acts ''in the name of'' did not necessitate the verbal declaration of the name in which they were done. Even Paul stated that every Christian should do ''all'' in the name of Jesus. 

{{quote|whatever ye may do in word or in work, [do] all things in the name of the Lord Jesus -- giving thanks to the God and Father, through him.|Colossians 3:17 YLT}}

Certainly he could not have meant saying the words &quot;in the name of Jesus&quot; after every single thing done -- it would have been impractical. It is more probable that when Paul said to do all in the name of Jesus he simply meant to ''glorify'' Christ in all that is done. 

{{quote|[to] glorify, then, God in your body and in your spirit...|1 Corinthians 6:20 YLT}}

When the words &quot;in the name of...&quot; were spoken it specified by what ''power and authority'' a particular action was being done. In those ancient times, a solider might have used the same words to announce by what authority he came or in who's authority certain actions were being orchestrated.

It is believed that on Pentecost over 3000 persons were baptized ''in water'' in the name of Jesus. 

{{quote|Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.|Acts 2:31 NKJV}}

If we suppose that is the case then it becomes equally unlikely and impractical for Peter and the other apostles to have said the words, &quot;I baptize you in the name of Jesus,&quot; three thousand times in one day.  

The gospels reveal no instance where it is recorded that words were explicitly spoken over those being baptized. The closest thing we have to a depiction of a baptismal event is when Philip baptized the Ethiopian in Acts 8. Even in that instance there is no mention of the Ethiopian being baptized into any name or of any name having been spoken over him during the course of it. Most other instances in the scriptures only ever provide whether or not a baptism took place or not and in some cases it explicitly states the purification agent. 

That baptism was not always practiced by saying, &quot;in the name of Jesus&quot; can be further seen from the dispute that arose in Corinth in which Paul stated:

{{quote|For it has been declared to me concerning you... that there are contentions among you. Now I say this, that each of you says, &quot;I am of Paul,&quot; or &quot;I am of Apollos,&quot; or &quot;I am of Cephas,&quot; or &quot;I am of Christ.&quot; Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, lest anyone should say that I had baptized in my own name.|1 Corinthians 1:11-15 NKJV}}

Had those of Corinth been baptized by a baptizer speaking the words, &quot;I baptize you in the name of Jesus&quot;, then it is unlikely that there would have been such a dispute. It is more plausible that if such words were spoken during baptism then they were spoken inconsistently by those that baptized in the early church.

===Saving Power===

It was also ''supposed'' in the course of time that in the waters of baptism there existed a ''sanctifying virtue'' that was able to wash away sins. The use of water baptism as a call to reformation and remission of sins turned into water baptism as the power whereby sins are remissed.

{{quote|In the age immediately following that of the apostles, we find that ''baptism'' and ''regeneration'' were used as synonymous terms; and whereas, originally, the pardon of sin was supposed to be the consequence of that reformation of life which was only ''promised'' at baptism, it was now imagined that there was something in the ''rite itself'', to which that grace was annexed; and in general it seems to have been imagined that this ''sanctifying virtue'' was in the ''water''|Priestley, Joseph|An History of the Corruptions on Christianity p. 170}}

{{quote|.. along with other superstitious notions, they got the idea of the efficacy of baptism as such to wash away sins, and consequently of the peculiar safety of dying presently after they were baptized, before any fresh guilt could be contracted.|Priestley, Joseph|An History of the Corruptions on Christianity p. 167}}

{{quote|(We) become children of choice and knowledge and obtain in the water the remission of sins|Ante-Nicene Christian Library, Vol. II, p. 59}}

{{quote|When once it was imagined that a person newly baptized was cleansed from all sin, it is no wonder that many persons deferred this sanctifying rite as long as possible, even till they apprehended that they were at the point of death. We find many cases of this kind at the beginning of the third century. Constantine the Great was not baptized till he was at the last gasp, and in this he was followed by his other sons, Constantine and Constans, were killed before they were baptized.|Priestley, Joseph|An History of the Corruptions on Christianity p. 171}}

From this notion it is not hard to imagine where the belief came from that baptism was necessary to salvation if sins were necessarily washed by it.

{{quote|After this we are not surprised to find (and it appears as early as the second century) that both baptism and the Lord's supper were thought to be necessary to salvation.|Priestley, Joseph|An History of the Corruptions of Christianity p. 7}}

Conversely, Paul in his letter to the Romans states that the true power unto salvation is in the gospel.

{{quote|For I am not ashamed of the ''gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation'' to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.|Romans 1:16}}

==Two Baptisms==

There are two baptisms mentioned in the New Testament: the baptism of John and the baptism of Jesus. 

{{quote|I [John] baptize you with water, but he [Jesus] will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.|Mark 1:8 NIV &lt;ref&gt;Matthew 3:11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|but I [Jesus] have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I pressed till it may be completed!|Luke 12:50 YLT}}

{{quote|Water-baptism is connected with the name of John, the baptism of the Spirit with the name of Jesus|MacNair, Robert|Christian Baptism, Spiritual not Ritual pp. 14-15}}

John's baptism was a baptism of the law and Jesus' baptism was of liberty&lt;ref&gt;2 Corinthians 3:17&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{quote|The righteousness of that ordinance of water baptism, was at best but under or during the law of outward commandments.|Scott, John|[http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24996588M/The_baptism_of_Christ_a_gospel_ordinance The baptism of Christ, a gospel ordinance being altogether inward and spiritual] p. 19}}

{{quote|Thus some who begin in the Spirit, turn about and seek to be made perfect in the flesh, or outward ordinances.|Scott, John. [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24996588M/The_baptism_of_Christ_a_gospel_ordinance The baptism of Christ, a gospel ordinance being altogether inward and spiritual] p. 26}}

Many of the outward ordinances of the Old Testament were types that have their proper anti-type in the New Testament. In other words, the ordinances of the Old Testament were merely shadows of what was later to be revealed - so too with baptism. When Jesus was baptized, he was baptized in both water and spirit; in one man both the type and the anti-type met.

{{quote|Now therefore cometh Jesus to be baptized of John in the Jordan; for it was now time those knew him, who were thus prepared for him, that they might receive him. His thus coming to John, and being first baptized in the type, and then in the antitype, the Holy Ghost from heaven, confirmed John’s knowledge of him.|Scott, John|[http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24996588M/The_baptism_of_Christ_a_gospel_ordinance The baptism of Christ, a gospel ordinance being altogether inward and spiritual] p. 30}}

The apostle Peter came to understand the distinction between the baptism which puts away the filth of the flesh and the baptism which puts away the filth of the mind.

{{quote|also to which an ''antitype'' doth now save us -- baptism, (''not a putting away of the filth of flesh, but the question of a good conscience in regard to God'',) through the rising again of Jesus Christ|1 Peter 3:21 YLT}}

{{quote|(not by works that [are] in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness,) ''He did save us, through a bathing of regeneration and renewing* of the Holy Spirit''|Titus 3:5 YLT}}

{{quote|In short, water baptism and Christ’s are plainly type and anitype; and accordingly Peter, speaking of the baptism which now saves, uses the Greek work antitypon.|Scott, John|[http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24996588M/The_baptism_of_Christ_a_gospel_ordinance The baptism of Christ, a gospel ordinance being altogether inward and spiritual] p. 7}}

The scriptures go on to state that there is one baptism &lt;ref&gt;Ephesians 4:5&lt;/ref&gt;; but they don't explicitly state which baptism that one baptism is.

==Holy Spirit==

Ancient Hebrew and Greek made no distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters therefore when it is written in our English bibles ''Holy Spirit'', and is capitalized as such, it is done at the preference or bias of the translator. The notion that the holy spirit is an actual person or ghost of God that inhabits men is rooted in superstition and mysticism. The holy spirit is the personification of the spirit of someone who believes in the holy one of God -- that is, in Christ.

It was thought during Jesus' time that humans could be inhabited by spirits from supernatural realms; these were the ''philosophies of the day'' or the superstitions of the age. Men of that age determined whether or not an individual was  possessed based on what that individual ''said'' and ''did''. A man who appeared mad was characterized as having a spirit of madness and a man who appeared charitable was characterized as having a spirit of charity. Out of the ordinary traits were attributed to out of the ordinary causes. It was what men ''said'' and ''did'' after hearing the gospel that caused them to be characterized as having had the holy spirit come upon them.

{{quote|It is a common idiom among the Jews, to put ''spirit'' before any quality ascribed to a person, whether it be good or bad, mental or corporeal. Thus the spirit of fear, the spirit of meekness, the spirit of slumber, the spirit of jealousy, are used to express habitual infirmity...|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 102}}

{{quote|Mankind have always been [very ready] to ascribe the unknown cause of extraordinary appearances to something to which they can give the name spirit.|Priestley, Joseph|Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit p. 210}}

Today, a mad man would not be classified as having a demon inhabiting him but rather would be classified as having a mental disorder. In a like manner, a man with the holy spirit should not be classified as having a spirit from God inhabiting his body, but rather should be classified as having a belief in God or in his Christ.

Hence the reason why Paul could truly say that he came not to water baptize but to preach the gospel; because the preaching of the gospel was what stirred individuals to have a spirit of holiness.

==Conclusion==

The outward baptism is good to the purifying of the outward man and his flesh while the inward baptism is good to the purifying of the inward man and his spirit. The outward cleansing is of the body through the water and the inward cleansing is of the mind through the word. The baptism of man is that outward cleansing and the baptism of the holy spirit is that inward cleansing. 

{{quote|Then the Lord said to him, &quot;Now you Pharisees make the outside of the cup and dish clean, but your inward part is full of greed and wickedness. Foolish ones! Did not He who made the outside make the inside also? But rather give alms of such things as you have; then indeed all things are clean to you. But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass by justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone.&quot;|Luke 11:39-42 NKJV}}

The cleansing of the entire constitution of man, both inward and outward, is figuratively of water and spirit. 

{{quote|Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.|John 3:5 KJV}}

{{quote|We shall no more be born of material water than we shall be baptized with material fire.|Moon, J.H|Water baptism p. 40}} 

To cleanse human nature is to take up divine nature; and the nature of the divine is to love one another.

{{quote|Let not therefore him who is outwardly baptized, suppose he has therein something that belongs to the gospel; neither let him who rejects it, either Quaker or other, think he therefore has something; for outward baptism is nothing evangelical, and the mere rejection of it is nothing – ''The new creature, the living faith of the operation of God, working by love, is all in all''|Scott, John| [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24996588M/The_baptism_of_Christ_a_gospel_ordinance The baptism of Christ, a gospel ordinance being altogether inward and spiritual] p. 33}}

{{quote|Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is ''born of God'', and knoweth God.|1 John 4:7 KJV}}

{{quote|And above all things have fervent love for one another, for &quot;love will cover a multitude of sins.&quot;|1 Peter 4:8 NKJV}}

==After Thoughts==

I tried to find the most defensible position to be taken on baptism but the truth is that no where in the scriptures does it clearly define what constitutes baptism. All that exists in the scriptures are inconsistent or insufficient depictions of baptismal events. Perhaps the lack of a scriptural treatise on baptism is exactly what has given rise to all the dogmas concerning it.

==Further Reading==

==Infallible==

The doctrine of the infallibility of the scriptures asserts that the Bible is the inerrant word of God. If the argument of the doctrine were valid we would expect to not find any inconsistencies in the text, otherwise God by association would be found to be inconsistent.

{{quote|It is expected, in mere human productions, that errors will frequently appear; but in a work that is divine, there can be no excuse for faults of any kind, not even in a single instance.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature pp. 106-107}}

The gospels in their infancy were the subject of several modifications. 

{{quote|The lesson to be learned from the history of the three texts above examined is this: First, it is quite erroneous to assert... that the text of the gospels bears no trace of having been altered anywhere for dogmatic or doctrinal reasons. On the contrary, here are three texts [in Matthew] which have been so altered. And, what is more, the interpolated texts have been regularly appealed to for centuries and centuries in defense of the very doctrines in half of which they were inserted.|Conybeare, Fred. C|[http://archive.org/stream/hibbertjournal01londuoft#page/112/mode/2up The Hibbert Journal, Doctrinal Modifications] p. 112}}

Even throughout the centuries modifications occurred. For example, the ending of Mark was interpolated from the other gospels yet in the most ancient manuscripts of Mark there exists no ending. That is worrisome considering the fact that most scholars believe Mark to have been the most ancient gospel and that all the other gospels to have borrowed from it.

In order for a continued justification of the doctrine it is said that ''only'' the ancient ''original'' manuscripts, which are no longer existent, were infallible. But to assert such a statement is to infer that the manuscripts that we have today are inferior to the originals and the natural conclusion being that the Bible as it is in its many translations is not the infallible word of God.

{{quote|What was written in the 'original originals' is quite unknown. It is important to remember that the words 'authorized' and 'original', as applied to the Bible do not mean 'genuine', 'authentic' or 'true'.|Adams, Robert|[http://www.rense.com/general66/hide.htm Behind the Bible Fraud - What was the Church Trying to Hide]}}

==Authenticity==

Many of the books in the Bible were not written by those who they are generally attributed to. There is no evidence that Moses wrote the first five books of the Old Testament nor any evidence that the apostles themselves wrote the gospels. It is only ''tradition'' that has upheld these beliefs. Saint Augustine's argument with Faustus reveals that even in Saint Augustine's time this fact was known of the writings of the New Testament.

{{quote|It is not without reason that we bring a critical judgment to the study of Scriptures where there are such discrepancies and contradictions. By thus examining everything, and comparing one passage with another, we determine which contains Christ's actual words, and what may or may not be genuine. For your predecessors have made many interpolations in the words of our Lord, which thus appear under His name, while they disagree with His doctrine. ''Besides, as we have proved again and again, the writings are not the production of Christ or of His apostles, but a compilation of rumors and beliefs, made, long after their departure, by some obscure semi-Jews, not in harmony even with one another, and published by them under the name of the apostles, or of those considered the followers of the apostles, so as to give the appearance of apostolic authority to all these blunders and falsehoods.''|Saint Augustine|[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/140633.htm Contra Faustum, Book XXXIII]}}

==Stories==

There are many stories held up by the Christian community at large as being factual and literal that are merely mythological. What follows is some exceptions to many of the notable ones.

{{quote|There is as much reason to believe Mahomet as to believe Moses and Jesus, and their apostles and followers. The fact is, ''there is no reason to believe any of them, unless the stories which they relate are consistent with the nature of things''...|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 73}}

===Creation Myth===

The creation story in Genesis suffers from a lack of knowledge concerning the nature of the solar system. It depicts the existence of days without the Sun.

{{quote|One thing, however, is remarkable in the account, that there were three days and three nights before the creation of the sun, which is the sole cause of day and night. This proves that Moses, or whoever wrote the 1st chapter of Genesis, was neither a good world-maker, nor a good astronomer... Moses makes day and night without the existence of a sun|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 52}}

It could easily be said that those &quot;days&quot; are only metaphorical in nature but surely that provides little solace to the mind. If that is the case it could likewise be inferred that ''all'' astronomical events and bodies (such as the Sun and Moon) that are mentioned are only metaphorical. The whole story might as well be metaphorical - the end result being that the story is a myth.

===Flood Myth===

The main of the flood story is that the earth was full of the most vile unrighteousness and it was God's desire to cleanse it with a flood. God is said to have had thoughts only to save one man and his family who were said to have been righteous. It would have been just as easy, if God was going to act in a miraculous way, for him to send an angel of death as it would have been to create a flood to cover the earth. Furthermore, it is unclear why God required Noah to invest his time and energy to build an ark that would be useless afterwards. He could have simply asked Noah to climb the highest mountain and only caused the flood to go to a certain height; the results would have been very much the same. Or God could have teleported Noah and all the animals into the heavens while he flooded the place.

{{quote|Noah is supposed to have packed pairs of all animals into his ark. The writer was probably aware of only the animals in his neighborhood in spinning this yarn. He would not have spun such stories if he were aware (nor did the almighty disclose it to him) of the thousands of millions of species of animals, birds and snakes on this earth.|William, Xavier|World Religions KL 7906-7909}}

===Charter Myth===

The story of the Israelites leaving Egypt in ''exodus'' is questionable because there exists no archelogical evidence that establishes the credibility of the story. There exists no evidence of a mass of Israelites having lived in Egypt or for that matter having left Egypt. 

{{quote|And the Lord said to Moses, &quot;I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. Afterward he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will surely drive you out of here altogether. Speak now in the hearing of the people, and let every man ask from his neighbor and every woman from her neighbor, articles of silver and articles of gold.&quot;|NKVJ|Exodus 11:1-2}}

God is quoted as commanding the Israelites to ''steal'' the valuables of the Egyptians. Such a command is in direct violation of the law that God was said to have given them. The 10 commandments explicitly state,

{{quote|Thou shalt not steal.|KJV|Exodus 20:15}}

The Exodus depicts God as sending mixed signals to his people and to all peoples of the earth by commanding a particular tribe to do one thing and then later telling them they should not do that one thing he previously commanded them to do.

{{quote|When the chosen people of God were able to leave the land of Egypt, he commanded them to borrow from the Egyptians, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, without any intention of ever returning them to their proper owners, but to march off and appropriate them exclusively to their own use. Here was deception, and a breach of trust of so black a complexion, that is was very ltitle better than downright theft or open plunder.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb p. 108}}

===War Stories===

There are many war stories in the Old Testament in which God ''commanded'' the Israelites to go to war with another people often unprovoked. Here is another instance where the God of the Israelites commands one thing and later commands the exact opposite. In other words, God is sending mixed messages to his people which only instills in them inconsistent behavioral patterns.

{{quote|Thou shalt not kill.|KJV|Exodus 20:13}}

When Moses came down from Mt. Sinai with that commandment and saw the people of Israel worshipping a golden calf he was instructed by God to tell the faithful portion to murder the unfaithful portion. 

{{quote|And he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.|KVJ|Exodus 32:27}}

It is odd to observe that in most cases in the scriptures, mankind is left to do God's killing for him especially when God could more easily put to death every unfaithful person. Had God done the killing himself there would have been less of a total loss of life since the faithful wouldn't have needlessly died in combat.

{{quote|The Bible tells us, that those assassinations were done by the ''express command of God''. To believe, therefore, the Bible to be true, we must ''unbelieve'' all our belief in the moral justice of God; for wherein could crying or smiling infants offend? And to read the Bible without horror, we must undo everything that is tender, sympathizing, and benevolent in the heart of man.|Paine, Thomas|The age of reason p. 62}}

There are other instances where God ''directly'' tells the Israelites to go and kill all the people of the land - men, women and children. It perplexes the mind why God told mankind not to murder if he was later going to sanction murder in his name. The command would have been better restated, &quot;Thou shalt not kill unless I tell thee.&quot; By which the entirety of the commandments could be reinterpreted, &quot;Do or don't do unless I tell you&quot;. The end result being, that rather than the commandments being a holy/sacred/unbroken law, they instead become a method for control and manipulation. 

It is no surprise then that the Old Testament reads as wartime propaganda. One of the necessary precursors to war is a demonization of the enemy and that can be clearly seen in the scriptures where every next-door neighbor is declared an enemy of God. A man will more readily charge into battle if he believes he has the backing of his country and the backing of a supernatural being. The priest class preached that fanatical message of nationalism supported by supernaturalism. Any man who would even dare marry a foreigner was considered to have done an act unholy in the sight of God and punishable by death. An immortalization of the heroes or kings of war can also be seen in the scriptures  most prominently in the character of King David who is said to have slaughtered thousands upon thousands of men for God's glory.

==Questionable Verses==

Here are a few of the questionable verses that I have come across authors mentioning. 

===Old Testament===

===== Curds and Honey =====

{{quote|Then he said, “Hear now, O house of David! Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel. Curds and honey He shall eat, that He may know to refuse the evil and choose the good.&quot;|Isaiah 7:13-15|NKJV}}

{{quote|There is one further observation upon the nature of this prophectic passage, which is, that after declaring that Emanuel should eat butter and honey, and the reason that is offered for this, is that he might know how to refuse the evil and choose the good; as if the way to discriminate with correctness between moral and immoral principles, was to live upon butter and honey.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. 98}}

===New Testament===

===== Love and Hate =====

{{quote|You have heard that it was said, &quot;You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.&quot; But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you...|Matthew 5:43-44|NKJV}}

{{quote|If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple.|Luke 14-26|NKJV}}

{{quote|In the gospel of St. Matthew, we are commanded to love our enemies. By what strange perversion of moral sentiment is it, that we are commanded in one place to hate our nearest relations, and in another to exercise a tender and affectionate regard to our implacable enemies.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. 112-113}}

===== Arbitrary Will =====

{{quote|For He says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion.”|Romans 9:15|NKJV}}

{{quote|He declares in some parts of the New Testament, that every thing shall be regulated by his arbitrary will without regard to the nature or character of the case. ''He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardenth.'' Is it possible that even a christian believer can suppose for a single moment, that the principles of genuine morality can rest upon such an arbitary basis?|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. 193}}

===== Doubting Thomas =====

{{quote|Now Thomas, called the Twin, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said to him, “We have seen the Lord.” So he said to them, “Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.” And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, “Peace to you!” Then He said to Thomas, “Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.” And Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!” Jesus said to him, “Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”|John 20:24-29|NKJV}}

{{quote|But it appears that Thomas did not believe the resurrection; and, as they say, would not believe without having ocular and manual demonstration himself. So neither will I, and the reason is equally as good for me, and for every other person, as for Thomas.|Paine, Thomas|The age of reason p. 13?}}

==Number Discrepancies==

Throughout the Bible there are many instances of related numbers being inconsistent which help form a strong argument against the Bible being inspired by God. Below are a few such instances.

===House of Jacob===

{{quote|And the sons of Joseph who have been born to him in Egypt [are] two persons. All the persons of the house of Jacob who are coming into Egypt [are] ''seventy''.|Genesis 46:27|YLT}}

{{quote|and Joseph having sent, did call for his father Jacob, and all his kindred -- with ''seventy and five souls''|Acts 7:14|YLT}}

&lt;sub&gt;Source: Macnaught, John. The doctrine of inspiration. p. 118&lt;/sub&gt;

===Exodus===

{{quote|And the dwelling of the sons of Israel which they have dwelt in Egypt [is] ''four hundred and thirty years'';|Exodus 12:40|YLT}}

{{quote|And God spake thus, That his seed shall be sojourning in a strange land, and they shall cause it to serve, and shall do it evil ''four hundred years''.|Acts 7:6|YLT}}

&lt;sub&gt;Source: Macnaught, John. The doctrine of inspiration. pp. 117-118&lt;/sub&gt;

===Whoredom===

{{quote|And Israel dwelleth in Shittim, and the people begin to go a-whoring unto daughters of Moab,... and the dead by the plague are ''four and twenty thousand''.|Numbers 25:1,9|YLT}}

{{quote|neither may we commit whoredom, as certain of them did commit whoredom, and there fell in one day ''twenty-three thousand''|1 Corinthians 10:8|YLT}}

&lt;sub&gt;Source: Macnaught, John. The doctrine of inspiration. p. 43&lt;/sub&gt;

{{quote|...in practice it turned out to not be such a good idea, because of the severe impact it had on the browser, so we moved on to outboard bittorrent clients like Red Swoosh and BitTorrent DNA, which are easy to integrate with the browser via http.

Making the web browser grow much larger, and keeping it constantly busy doing lots of extra network and disk io, and increasing the code complexity and risk it might crash, is just not a good idea in general. Separating the bittorrent client out into its own process that doesn't have any impact on the browser and can be shared by other applications, and communicating with it via http (one data channel and one control channel -- and no plugins) was a much cleaner and more robust solution.|Hopkins, Don|[http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2g7yqf/webtorrent_is_a_streaming_torrent_client_that/ WebTorrent Is A Streaming Torrent Client]}}</text>

The popular introductory video on Bitcoin &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo What is Bitcoin?]&lt;/ref&gt; tries and fails to answer the question, &quot;What is Bitcoin?&quot;.

 A bitcoin is a proof of ''wasted'' computational effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html Bit gold]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, skeleton parts and seashells were used as a medium of exchange; and if those, then why not ''wasted'' bits of computational effort. &lt;ref&gt;Szabo, Nick. [http://szabo.best.vwh.net/shell.html Shelling Out - The Origins of Money]. 2002, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Advantages==

===Debasement===

Both fiat money (money that is paper) and commodity money (money that is gold) can be debased. When commodity money was widely used, often governments would debase the coins by reducing their weight. Fiat money in use today, is also debased by our government when it increases the total quantity of notes in circulation. 

Money Masters correctly state of fiat money, &quot;''It is not what backs money that is important, it is who controls the quantity''&quot; and additionally I would say &quot;who controls the weights and measurements&quot; in the instance of commodity money.

{{quote|The selling point of Bitcoins (BTCs) is their value cannot be artificially debased.|Melchiorre, Matthew|[http://www.openmarket.org/2013/04/05/bitcoin-an-escape-from-currency-debasement/ Bitcoin: An Escape from Currency Debasement]}}

==Disadvantages==

===Deflation===

Deflation is a reduction in the quantity of money needed to sustain the economy. A fixed quantity of money will lead to deflation in an economy that experiences growth.

{{quote|... built-in deflation won't be helping anyone on the long term. That free money will encourage people to '''hoard BTCs forever''' or until another wishful investor buys them, '''fueling speculation and price bubbles'''. Bitcoin will ultimately be regarded as a phony investment with no real value, just like the good ol' Pyramid (Ponzi) Scheme where everyone purchases a ticket just to sell it to someone else later for a high profit until '''the whole system collapses when it runs out of new victims'''.|BitcoinTalk|The current Bitcoin economic model doesn't work &lt;ref name=&quot;bitcoin1&quot;&gt;[http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=57.0 The current Bitcoin economic model doesn't work], May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|The very fact that the '''newly-generated coin supply dwindles as its user base (hopefully) continues to grow will raise that 19% deflation rate even higher'''. Let alone that many coins are forever destroyed via HDD failures and lost thumb drives, pushing the deflation even higher and higher. '''High deflation is bad because nobody spends their money, they only save it because it gains value over time'''. Can you imagine what would've happened if, say, the Japanese government hasn't printed any (or very few) Yens during the last century while the population exploded? One 1911 Yen would have been more than enough to buy a house today. Who then would've spent their Yens in 1911? Why, almost noone of course!|BitcoinTalk|The current Bitcoin economic model doesn't work &lt;ref name=&quot;bitcoin1&quot;/&gt;}}

A currency which has a fixed supply of money will always end in a deflationary spiral when there a potential for that currency to become unrecoverable.

{{quote|A currency is used to enter transactions; the more transactions there are, the more of the money you need. As the economy grows, a fixed-supply currency becomes worth more in terms of goods and services, and people begin to hoard it—expecting that if they wait a little longer, they will be able to buy more. Once hoarding takes over, circulation ends, and with it the function of the currency.|[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2013/04/bitcoin_is_a_ponzi_scheme_the_internet_currency_will_collapse.html Bitcoin is a Ponzi Scheme: The Internet Currency Will Collapse]}}

Attempts to refute the deflationary spiral nature of Bitcoin often confuse deflation's cause with its effects. &lt;ref&gt;Cawrey, Dnaiel. [http://www.coindesk.com/deflation-and-bitcoins/ Could deflation cause problems for bitcoin?]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In order to play for keeps, put himself to the test, and know who he is, Jeder must take on a mortgage. In this country, he is not a man until he makes a down payment on a house, goes heavily into debt in business, or mortgages his working years to bring up his children. Those who have no mortgages are regarded as carefree, beautiful, or lucky people, but not as real people. The banker's television commericals show the great day in Jeder's life: the day he mortgages his earnings for the next twenty or thirty years to buy a house. The day he pays off the mortgage he is out of it and ready for the old people's home. This danger can be averted by taking on a bigger mortgage for a bigger house...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
''Most well-organized societies, in one way or another, provide a way for young people to mortgage themselves and thus give meaning to their lives. Otherwise they might just spend their time enjoying themselves, as they do still in a few places.'' In that case, there is no easy way of telling the winners from the losers. With a mortgage system, the population readily divides itself. People who don't even have enough gumption to mortgage themselves are losers (according to those who run the system). People who spend their lives paying off the mortgage, so they can never get much ahead, are the silent majority of nonwinners. The people who hold the mortgages are the winners.|Eric Berne|What To Say After You Say Hello}}

What can be said of mortgages can also be said of student loans or any form of debt which all mortgage your future earnings. In other words, any form of debt exposes your future to ''risk or constraint'' for the sake of ''immediate advantage''.

{{quote|Some people achieve ''temporary relief'' by accumulating possessions, by living in a bigger, better house than the Joneses, or even reveling in their modesty: I am humbler than you are. These maneuvers, which are based on what Adler called &quot;guiding fictions,&quot; may provide a welcome relief even though down the road may be a disaster in the form of an ''oppressive mortgage'' or consumptive bills, which commit the person to a life of perpetual drudgery.|Harris, Thomas|I'm OK - You're OK pg. 55}}</text>

{{quote|Among the Latins, all the words which describe demoniacs, or persons possessed by ghosts, include in them the idea of madness, or an alienation of mind. Their Larvati and Cerriti in particular, who answer exactly to the possessed with demons in the New Testament, were all madmen. To be full of larvae, or the ghosts of wicked men, was a phrase expressive of the most outrageous madness.|Farmer, Hugh|An essay on the demoniacs of the New Testament pp. 46-47}}

{{quote|Some of the Jews, offended with Christ's discourses said, &quot;He hath a demon, and is mad; why hear ye him?&quot; If we understand these words in the strictest sense, the Jews intended to reproach Christ both with possession and madness. For these two, when thus joined together are not necessarily to be understood as synonymous terms; possession may be put for the apprehended cause, and madness for the supposed effect.|Farmer, Hugh|An essay on the demoniacs of the New Testament p. 55}}

{{quote|Nor was it raving madness only that the Jews ascribed to demons, but that species of madness also called melancholy. &quot;When John came neither eating nor drinking, they say, He hath a demon.&quot; From his secluding himself from the cheerful converse of men, in the wilderness, and practising great abstinence and mortification they inferred that John was under the power of melancholy, and therefore possessed.|Farmer, Hugh|An essay on the demoniacs of the New Testament p. 57-58}}

{{quote|This was the case more especially with respect to epileptic diseases, the fits of which, it was affirmed, constantly returned every new and full moon. Galen says, &quot;the moon governs the periods of epileptic diseases;&quot; and others referred the disease entirely to this planet. Hence epilepsies were, by the Greeks and Latins, called lunatics.

{{quote|It hath never yet  been proven from reason, that the spirits of dead men have power to enter and torment the living; to govern their bodily organs in as perfect a manner as their own souls can do, to deprive them of their understandings, and to render them blind, deaf, and dumb. Nay, the advocates of possessions do now admit, that it is highly absurd to ascribe this power to the spirits of dead men. On this account it is, that they labour strenuously to prove, that by demons we are to understand fallen angels.|Farmer, Hugh|An essay on the demoniacs of the New Testament p. 89}}

{{quote|&quot;Goats (he observes) are remarkably subject to the epilepsy; and, on dissecting the head, the brain is found to be overcharged with a rheum of a very bad small; a plain proof (he adds) that the animal was diseased, not possessed by a diety.&quot;|Farmer, Hugh|An essay on the demoniacs of the New Testament p. 95}}

{{quote|For with regard to Saul, of whom we read that &quot;an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him,&quot; it is sufficent to observe, that the word spirit is often applied to the temper and affections of the human mind; and that the Jews were wont to call all kinds of melancholy an evil spirit. Saul's disorder, therfore, was a deep melancholy. This appears, not only from the language in which it is described, but also from the history of its cure; for it was not cured by prayer, but by music; a proper method of exhilarating the animal spirits, though not of expelling demons.|Farmer, Hugh|An essay on the demoniacs of the New Testament p. 103}}

{{quote|When Moses prescribed the means of being purified from the defilement of natural disorders, is it not strange that he appointed no method of being cleansed from the defilement even of a diabolical possession?|Farmer, Hugh|An essay on the demoniacs of the New Testament p. 104}}

{{quote|Especially as our Savior, when applying to himself the prophecies concerning his miracles, doth not specify the ejection of demons, though at that very time he cured many of evil spirits.|Farmer, Hugh|An essay on the demoniacs of the New Testament p. 105}} 

{{quote|If demons posses mankind, they must do it either by their own natural power, or by the power supernatural and miraculous, occasionally imparted to them by God for that purpose. That they do not posses mankind by a miraculous and divine power, seems evident from hence, that in this case the Deity must contradict himself, and counteract his own power in casting them out. Nor is it reasonable to suppose that demons have a natural power of possessing mankind.. Now, if demons have a natural power of entering the bodies of mankind, why did they not return to those bodies from which they were ejected?|Farmer, Hugh|An essay on the demoniacs of the New Testament pp. 110-111}} 

{{quotation|To these persons St. Paul thus addresses himself: &quot;We know that an idol is nothing in the world; and that there is none other God but one.&quot; Strong prejudices, aided by great parts, having prevented many from discerning the meaning of this plain passage, it will be necessary to exmain it with some attention.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Indeed, the original word, which we render idol, and which signifies an image or representation of things in the mind, is very frequently applied by the Greeks (to whom St. Paul is here writing) to ghosts or spectres, which were supposed to appear in the likeness, or to be an image and represetnation, of their former bodies. Hence they employed this term to describe their demons, who were the ghosts or images of dead men.|Farmer, Hugh|An essay on the demoniacs of the New Testament pp. 114-115}}  

{{quote|By all the ancient prophets, also, the heathen gods are spoken of as dead persons. Our apostle himself entertained the same opinion of them as the prophets did. Like them, he describes Jehovah by the title of the Living God, in order to distinguish him from the gods taken from amongst mortal men.|Farmer, Hugh|An essay on the demoniacs of the New Testament p. 131}}  

{{quote|This seems to me much more probable, than that interfnal spirits should freely and zealously assert the divine claims, and spread the glory of Jesus as the Messiah.|Farmer, Hugh|An essay on the demoniacs of the New Testament p. 147}}

{{quote|When I gave him my standard objections to reliance on medication (worry about side effects, concerns about drug dependency, discomfort with the idea of taking pills that might affect my mind and change who I am), he resorted to the cliched - but nonetheless potent - diabetes argument, which goes like this: &quot;Your anxiety has a biological, physiological, and genetic basis; it is a medical illness, just like diabetes is. If you were a diabetic, you wouldn't have such qualms about taking insulin, would you?&quot;|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 152}}

However, blood glucose levels can be easily measured but the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain associated with anxiety or depression cannot.

===Anti-depressants===

The development of the neurotransmitter-based theory of mental health is here summarized:

{{quote|In 1954, Marthe Vogt, a German neuroscientist at the University of Edinburgh, discovered the first convincing evidence of a neurotransmitter - norepinephrine. Later that year John Henry Gaddum, a colleague of Vogt's, discovered through a series of unorthodox experiments that serotonin, which until that point was thought to be a gut-based compound involved in digestion, was also a neurotransmitter. Gaddam took LSD - which he reported made him feel crazy for forty-eight hours and which also, according to laboratory measurements, decreased the level of serotonin metabolites in his cerebrospinal fluid. His broad conclusion: Serotonin helps keep you mentally healthy - and therefore a deficiency of serotonin can make you mentally ill.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety pp. 172-173}}

Only about 3-4% of the body's total serotonin is located in the brain. Over 90% of it located in the gastrointestinal tract, where it is used to regulate intestinal movements. &lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin Serotonin]&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|None other than the father of the serotonin hypothesis of depression, Arvid Carlsson, has announced that psychiatry must relinquish it. In 2002, at a conference in Montreal, he declared that we must &quot;abandon the simplistic hypothesis&quot; that disordered emotion is the result of &quot;either an abnormally high or abnormally low function of a given neurotransmitter.&quot;|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 218}}

[http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=185157 Antidepressant Drug Effects and Depression Severity]

*  &quot;Antidepressant medications represent the best established treatment for major depressive disorder, but ''there is little evidence that they have a specific pharmacological effect relative to pill placebo for patients with less severe depression''.&quot;

====SSRIs====

{{quote|Exploding into the national consciousness with the March 26, 1990, edition of Newsweek, whose cover featured a green-and-white capsule alongside the words &quot;A Breakthrough Drug for Depression,&quot; fluoxetine, under its trade name Prozac, would become the iconic antidepressent of the late twentieth century - a blockbuster for its manufacturer, Eli Lilly... [who] killed the drug in development ''seven times'' because of unconvincing test results. After examining tepid fluoxetine trial outcomes, as well as complaints about the drug's side effects, German regulators in 1984 concluded, &quot;Considering the benefit and the risk, we think this preparation totally unsuitable for the treatment of depression.&quot;|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety pp. 208-209}}

{{quote|A series of studies in the 1980s found imipramine, the tricyclic antidepressant, to be more effective than Prozac for treating patients with depression or panic disorder. Imipramine also trounced Paxil in two studies in the early 1980s of patients with depression. In 1989, Paxil failed to beat a placebo in more than half of its trials. Yet four years later, Paxil was approved by the FDA - and by 2000 it was the best-selling anti-depressant on the market, outselling Prozac and Zoloft.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 209}}

{{quote|In Janurary 2010, almost exactly twenty years after introducing Americans to SSRIs, Newsweek published a cover story reporting on studies that suggested these drugs are barely as effective as sugar pils for the treatment of anxiety and depression.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 213}}

{{quote|After reviewing dozens of studies on SSRI effectiveness, the British Medical Journal concluded that Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, and the other drugs in the SSRI class &quot;do not have clinically meaningful advantage over placebo.&quot;|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 213}}

[https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/obsessively-yours/201001/five-reasons-not-take-ssris Five reasons not to take SSRIs]

* &quot;Doctors are in essence performing uncontrolled experiments on their patients, hoping that in some scattershot way they might hit on a solution.&quot;
* &quot;We have no way of measuring serotonin in the brain of a living person, short of cutting open the skull. We have not come up with what a normal level of serotonin should be and below which we can say that you would be depressed and above which we can say you will be happy. People with high serotonin levels can be depressed and those with low levels can be happy.&quot;
* &quot;We're not talking about anecdotal evidence as in 'they worked for me.' That level of proof applies to quack medicines and systems... We believe that the only true proof for efficacy is double-blind, randomized trials of drugs in which neither the person taking the drug nor the person administering the drug knows if the drug is real or placebo. With that high level of proof we now know that SSRIs do not work on any kind of depression other than severe depression, which is quite rare.&quot;

====MAOIs====

{{quote|When patients taking MAOIs ingest things - such as wine and other fermented alcohol, aged cheeses,  pickled foods, some kinds of beans, and many over-the-counter medications - that contain high levels of an amino acid derivative called tyramine, the health effects can be serious: painful headaches, jaundice, a spike in blood pressure, and in some cases severe internal hemorrhaging.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 170}}

====Causes for doubt====

* Medications that require cycling through various brands until the patient hits upon one that works.
* Medications that take an abnormally long and varying amount of time for it to work.
* Medications that are potentially more harmful than they are helpful (suicidal ideation).
* Diagnosis's that are largely based on the subjectivity of the doctor and not based on any biological testing.
* Medications where it is hard for the doctor to diagnosis whether or not the patient is experiencing a harmful side-effect or worsening of initial symptoms.

===Tranquilizers===

{{quote|Every time new drug therapies come along, they raise the question of where the line between anxiety as psychiatric disorder and anxiety as a normal problem of living should get drawn. We see this again and again throughout the history of pharmacology: the rise of tranqualizers is followed by an increase in anxiety disorders diagnoses; the rise of antidepressants is followed by an increase in the rate of depression.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 188}}

====Benzodiazepines====

{{quote|By the end of the decade, Librium and Valium had made Hoffman-La Roche -- &quot;the house that Leo built&quot; -- the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world. The benzodiazepines had become the greatest commercial success in the history of prescription drugs.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 195}}

{{quote|By the middle of the 1970s, the FDA had collected numerous reports of benzodiazepine dependence. Many patients who had been on high dosages of Valium or Librium for long periods of time would experience excrucitating physical and psychological symptoms when they stopped taking the medication: anxiety, insomnia, headaches, tremors, blurred vision, ringing in the ears, the feeling that insects were crawling all over them, and extreme depression - and, in some cases, seizures, convulsions, hallucinations, and paranoid delusions. By the time Ted Kennedy led the 1979 Senate hearings on the hazards of benzodiazepines, critics had a rich literature of horror stories to draw on.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety p. 195}}

{{quote|&quot;Valium, Librium, and other drugs of that class cause damage to the brain. I have seen damage to the cerebral cortex that I believe is due to the use of these drugs, and I am beginning to wonder if the damage is permanent,&quot; David Knott, a physician at the University of Tennessee, warned back in 1976. In the three decades since then, scores of articles in scientific journals have reported on the cognitive impairment observed in long-term benzodiazepine users. A 1984 study by Malcolm Lader found that the brains of people who took tranquilizers for a long time physically shrank.|Stossel, Scott|My Age of Anxiety pp. 198-199}}

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_withdrawal_syndrome Benzodiazepine withdrawl syndrome]

* &quot;Withdrawal effects caused by sedative-hypnotics discontinuation, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or alcohol, can cause serious medical complications. They are cited to be more hazardous to withdraw from than opioids. Users typically receive little advice and support for discontinuation. ''Some withdrawal symptoms are identical to the symptoms for which the medication was originally prescribed.''&quot;
* &quot;There may be ''no fundamental differences'' in symptoms from either ''high or low dose discontinuation'', but symptoms tend to be more severe from higher doses.&quot;
* &quot;Symptoms may emerge during ''gradual'' or ''abrupt'' dosage reduction.&quot;
* &quot;Failure to recognize discontinuation symptoms can lead to ''false evidence for the need to take benzodiazepines'', which in turn leads to withdrawal failure and reinstatement of benzodiazepines, often to higher doses.&quot;
* &quot;Protracted withdrawal syndrome refers to symptoms persisting for ''months or even years''.&quot;

* &quot;Colloquially known as benzos, the drugs have been in use since the 1950s. In the 1960s and ’70s, Valium became one of the most successful prescription drugs ever.&quot;
* &quot;Meanwhile, in the U.K., controlled trials showed conclusively that withdrawal symptoms from regular therapeutic doses of benzos were real and that they stemmed from ''physical dependence'' on the drug&quot;
* &quot;An editorial in the British Medical Journal questioned whether benzodiazepines should be ''banned'' altogether.&quot;
* &quot;But in the U.S., the warning largely went unheeded. Drug companies introduced Ativan in 1977 for anxiety and Xanax in 1981 to treat panic disorder. The drugs routinely topped the list of the most prescribed and most profitable drugs.&quot;
* &quot;First-line treatments for anxiety disorders are generally selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, the so-called SSRIs, such as Prozac or Zoloft. ''Some patients have a genetic variation that blocks the SSRIs’ effect''.&quot;
* &quot;Moreover, because the symptoms of withdrawal often mirror the symptoms of the original condition they were treating, doctors often assume the original condition has returned and patients need a higher dose or to take the medication more frequently.&quot;

* &quot;The results of recent studies do not offer any convincing evidence that fish oil supplements either prevent cardiovascular disease or improve outcomes in patients who already have it.&quot;

====Valerian====

{{quote|Valerian is most often used as an alternative medicine for insomnia in place of hypnotic drugs. It is also sometimes used as an alternative for sedatives, such as benzodiazepines, in the treatment of certain anxiety disorders. Whether or not valerian is an efficacious treatment for insomnia is still a very open question. Multiple recent systematic reviews of the medical research literature and meta-analyses have produced conflicting conclusions regarding its efficacy.|Wikipedia|[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerian_(herb)#Medicinal_use Valerian]}}

* &quot;The effects resemble the effects of both stimulants and psychedelics and are reported to ''decrease fear'' and increase trust and empathy&quot;
* &quot;Brain scans have revealed that MDMA ''decreases blood flow to the amygdalla'', a brain region responsible for fear, and ''increases blood flow to the prefrontal cortex'', where higher order functions are processed. It also releases serotonin and other feel-good neurotransmitters, as well as naturally occurring hormones prolactin and oxytocin.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7960">The idea of there being fallen angels is a part of the doctrines of Christian system and it is generally thought that these angels fell when they were led away from God by the chief of all angels.

== Causes for Doubt ==

# How can an incorruptible being sow the seed of corruption?
# How can a holy angel sin at any point in time in the holy presence of God?
# How can God reside in defilement, if the angels sinned in heaven, and heaven is his abode?

Furthermore the narrative about angels having fallen from heaven is a repetitive one. In the beginning, we were presented with the story of man having fallen and now after stitching the rest of the story together it is suggested that the angels fell too.

== Jude 1:5-6 ==
Verses where fallen angels are ''inferred'',

{{quote|5 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not. 6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.|Jude 1:5-6 KJV}}

Commentary that provides reasonable exegesis for the reference to &quot;''angels which kept not their first estate''&quot; mentioned in Jude 1:6

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;With that said, let’s begin to understand what is meant by the word 'angels' in Jude 6. In verse 5, Jude reminds his readers of something they already knew; &quot;''I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this.''&quot; We must ask ourselves the question; what is it that Jude is reminding his readers of? The answer has to do with the period following the Exodus from Egypt and while the people are in the Wilderness; as verse 5 explains; &quot;''how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not''&quot;. This is the context for verse 6. We should also note that verse 6 begins with the word 'And.' Therefore, we should take verses 5 and 6 together; &quot;''how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not and the angels which kept not their first estate, ...''&quot;. There is no reason for Jude to go off at a tangent in verse 6 and talk of another event outside the events he is drawing our attention to. The remainder of verse 6 is a metaphor which we also have to understand and this will be explained later once we have established who the 'angels' are in verse 6.

The Greek word 'angelos', simply means a 'messenger' and can apply to humans. The word can be used of priests, ministers, and apostles or whoever relayed God’s message. The notion that the word 'angels' only applies to God’s Holy Angels is wrong. Had the translators used the word 'messengers', 'ministers', or 'priests', the thought of God’s Holy Angels would never have come to mind. The word 'angel' does not have to have supernatural connotations.

In the context of something that happened after the people were delivered from Egypt, we have to find out who were killed and why.

There are several groups who were destroyed in the wilderness and these are;

# The 10 spies sent out to survey the Promised Land
# All the congregation who murmured and disbelieved God
# Korah, Dathan and Abiram and their 250 followers

Group 2 we can rule out as being 'angels' because they had no specific message to give. Group 1 brought back a message about what they found in the Promised Land, but there is nothing in this story that suggests the spies 'left their first estate'. In other words, the spies had not sought to elevate themselves for what they had done. Group 3 were men to give God's message to the people and who could be considered to have &quot;left their first estate&quot;. This makes Group 3 the obvious choice to be the 'angels.' There is no record during the wilderness journey (or ever) involving God’s Holy Angels rebelling and sinning.&lt;/poem&gt;|David.

== 2 Peter 2:4-5 ==
Verses where fallen angels are ''inferred'',

{{quote|4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; 5 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;|2 Peter 2:4-5 KJV}}

The same exegesis above for Jude 1:5-6 also applies to 2 Peter 2:4-5. However, there exists commentary that provides a reasonable exegesis for the differing chronological order of events between Jude 1:5-6 and 2 Peter 2:4-5

{{quote|It will be noted that in Peter's epistle, &quot;the angels that sinned&quot; is placed chronologically before the time of (2 Peter 2:4, 5), whereas in Jude's epistle, it is placed after the exodus of Israel from Egypt. (Jude 5, 6). There are too many similarities between the two epistles to conclude that the accounts refer to two different occasions on which &quot;angels sinned&quot;. Rather Jude's epistle must be regarded as setting out the chronological order of events since in verse 6 the Greek text is syntactically connected with verse 5, thereby implying the historical sequence. But why the reversal of historical allusions in Peter's account? Because verse 4 in Peter's account is connected with verse 1. &quot;''But there were false prophets also among the people'' (i.e., Israel of old) ''even as there shall be false teachers among you...''&quot; Verses 2 and 3 are a warning of false teachers to come in the future, but verse 4 reverts to verse 1 and illustrates the judgment of God upon false prophets in Israel. In verses 5-7, Peter guided by the Holy Spirit, selects two additional illustrations from Old Testament history. &lt;ref&gt;[http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090604182328AA1he0m Christadelphians: Who were the &quot;angels&quot; mentioned in 2 Peter 2:4 and Jude 6?]&lt;/ref&gt;| Christadelphians: Who were the &quot;angels&quot; mentioned in 2 Peter 2:4 and Jude 6?}}

==Conclusion==

{{quotation|But if we understand by Angels in these passages angelic Spirits, how could God's casting them out of heaven down to Tartarus, be any warning to ungodly men? No man had seen this done, or had any means of knowing the fact, if it was true. It rested entirely on Peter and Jude's statements in these passages, for no other sacred writer ever mentions such a remarkable event, as angels' sinning in heaven and being cast down to Tartarus. But the case of Korah and his company is detailed at length in the Jewish Scriptures, was well known, and calculated to be a warning to those who lived ungodly.|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry p. 95}}

The doctrine of God asserts there to be a Being, usually supernatural in origin, who created all things and is the highest authority when it comes to all things. Some say he plays an active roll in history, others say he is silent. 

==Nature==

God is said to have several essential qualities or universal properties. But these essential qualities break down when taken to the extreme and are therefore cannot be absolute. It is only ever ''inferred'' from scripture what God's nature is, though never ''explicitly'' stated anywhere. Rather, it is left to the theologian to concoct an answer. 

:The property of ''omniscience'' ascribes God with knowing all things. However, it is not possible for God to know those things which are logically impossible. It is only possible for God to know those things which are logically possible. In the event that God knew both that which was logically possible and not possible then the nature of God would be paradoxical and self-contradictory. Additionally, there is absolutely no point for a ''omniscient'' God to put his creation through tests and trials when he already knows exactly what they are going to do in each scenario.

However, neither God nor his prophets went to such troubles.|William, Xavier|World Religions KL 1427-1428}}

:The property of ''omnipresense'' ascribes God with being everywhere at once. However, if God were everywhere then all could lay claim to the notion that God is with them even in their most sinful and defiling acts. Furthermore there would be no need to ''call on the Lord'' considering that you only call somebody who is not there. The notion of God being everywhere serves only to confuse and rather justify mankind in any belief that would equate God with creation itself.

{{quote|In the same vein, God is omnipresent and so is the devil. Obviously, they cannot be mutually exclusive and have to coexist as a sort of very intimate amalgam.|William, Xavier|World Religions KL 1352-1353}}

The property of ''omnipotence'' ascribes God with having the power to do whatever he wants. However, it is not possible for God to contradict himself nor to destroy himself. Nor does he have the power to create a stone he cannot lift.

{{quote|All things, it is said, are possible with God. This is one of the maxims of that religion which has perverted all the principles of truth and justice; but this maxim is not true, it is not possible, for instance, that God should destroy his own existence; it is not possible that he should act inconsistently with the properties and principles of nature. This extravagant assertion, instead of exalting the character of the Creator, would absolutely destroy it, by causing him to act without rule and without justice.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 67}}

What is clear is that nobody has a distinct idea of what constitutes the nature of God but everybody is ready and willing to say he exists.

{{quote|But this I am sure, to one that can form no determined ideas of what they stand for, they signify nothing at all; and all that he thinks he knows about them, is to him so much knowledge about nothing, and amounts at most but to a learned ignorance.|Locke, John|Of the Conduct of the Understanding p. 71}}

If you want to say that 'God is energy,' then you can find God in a lump of coal.|Weinberg, Steven|Dreams of a Final Theory}}

==Miracles==

The doctrine of ''miracles'' supposes that ''supernatural'' beings can perform works in nature. However, any supernatural work done in nature would be a violation of the laws of nature. 

{{quote|A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature, by ''supernatural'' power.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 64}} 

{{quote|Every sensible deviation from or ''contradiction'' to the known laws of nature, must be an evident and incontestable miracle.|Farmer, Hugh|Dissertation on miracles p. 13}}

{{quote|A wonder-working God, who violates his own laws, and acts inconsistently with the principles which he himself has established, is no God at all.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 66}} 

{{quote|Another distinction from monotheism is found in the Christian belief in miracles, in which God intervenes in history from outside nature. Ancient Roman philosophers and others since objected to this Christian doctrine as God violating his own natural laws.|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_religion Natural Religion]|Wikipedia}}

{{quote|Mankind have conceived to themselves certain laws, by which what they call nature is supposed to act, and that a miracle is something contrary to the operation and effect of those laws, but unless we know the whole extent of those laws, and of what are commonly called the powers of nature, we are not able to judge whether anything that may appear to us wonderful or miraculous be within or be beyond, or be contrary to, her natural power of acting.|Paine, Thomas|The Age of Reason p. 51}}

In the event a work was properly ascertained to be a miracle, the next problem that would arise would be to whom it should be ascribed. There is said to be many supernatural beings at work in the heavens above and hells below. It is possible that any supernatural work could be the offspring of either God or Satan or any one of their servants. 

{{quote|If demons can inflict grievous diseases, deprive men of their reason and sense, render them dumb and blind, and cause them to suffer the most exquisite torments, they can work miracles: for the infliction of a disease by the agency of any spiritual being, answers to the definition of a miracle, as an affect produced in the system of nature, contrary to the general rules by which it is governed.|Balfour, Walter|Three inquiries p. 241}}

{{quote|It cannot, with any appearance of reason, be supposed, that the Supreme Being would put it in the power of any malevolent demon (supposing such beings to exist) thus to deceive his creatures, and without reserving to himself the power of undeceiving them. For if such beings as these were permitted to work real miracles, or perform such works as men were unable to distinguish from real miracles, it was all that himself could do; so that the mischief would be without remedy.|Priestly, Joseph|Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion pp. 240-241}}

When a miracle was alleged, it was usually ascribed to God if the miracle worked in favor of the person receiving it or ascribed to Satan if the miracle worked against the person receiving it. In this way, all good things are ascribed to God and all evil things are to Satan; two almost equal ''gods'' - one good, the other evil -- both feared.

==Prayer==

The doctrine of ''prayer'' supposes that we can communicate with God in order to affect change. In any form of communication there is a path where by a message is sent to a receipt. But what path communications to God go through are uncertain and seem to vary. 

'''What is the right way to pray?'''

It is commonly believed that messages can be sent to God either through simply ''thinking'' or through ''speaking''; some believers choose to prayer in their heads and others out loud. In the event that God is able to read our ''thoughts'', then it seems rather unnecessary for us to ''speak'' our minds to him. 

There is one example in the Old Testament, 1 Samuel 1:13, where God hears an unspoken prayer. While it says that the individual prayed with their heart, that can be attributed to a lack of knowledge concerning human anatomy. The ancients believed that the ''thinking faculty'' in man lay in his physical heart, but modern knowledge about human anatomy shows us that the thinking faculty in man lies in his brain. There are many examples in both the Old and New Testament where God hears a spoken prayer and some are even recorded. 

'''Consistency with the nature of God'''

Supposing God to be omniscient or all-knowing, communication with him would be altogether unnecessary. If God already knows what we are going to speak before we speak it or knows what we are going to think before we think it then the need to deliver a personal message to him is pointless. In other words, if the receipt already has the message, there is no need to send it to him again. 

Supposing God to be immutable or unchangable, asking him to give us something other than what he is already planning on giving us is again unnecessary since his mind is already made. 

{{quote|What is the amount of all his prayers, but an attempt to make the Almighty change his mind, and act otherwise than he does?|Paine, Thomas|The Age of Reason p. 64}}

'''Pray for the probable'''

When a believer asks God for something and receives what he asked for, he finds himself in harmony with God, and sees no fault in himself. When a believer asks God for something and does not receive what he asked for, he finds himself at odds with God, and sees fault in himself. In the event that the believer finds fault with himself, he will either become disillusioned and give up, or he will become emboldened and try harder. Those that would try harder only become more fanatical; making ever increasing gestures toward God to find favor with him.

The solution then for the believer would be to pray for those things which have a higher probability of happening and are soon to come. In this way, prayers have a more likely chance of being answered. For example, if any man asks God for air to breathe every day, he will find himself in favor with God, or praying according to God's will, every day of his life - except for his last. The odds then of that prayer being answered are better than for any odds found in any Las Vegas casino. Those believers who pray for things which have a lower probability of happening and are far off, will rarely have their prayers answered and see themselves shamefully.

'''Efficacy of prayer'''

For the past 120 years or so the efficacy of prayer has been questioned by great scientific minds.

{{quote|Had prayers for the sick any notable effect, it is incredible but that the doctors, who are always on the watch for such things, should have observed it, and added their influence to that of the priests towards obtaining them for every sick man.|Galton, Francis|Statistical Inquiries into the Efficacy of Prayer}}

{{quote|If prayerful habits had influence on temporal success, it is very probable, as we must again repeat, that insurance offices, of at least some descriptions, would long ago have discovered and made allowance for it. It would be most unwise, from a business point of view, to allow the devout, supposing their greater longevity even probable, to obtain annuities at the same low rates as the profane.|Galton, Francis|Statistical Inquiries into the Efficacy of Prayer}}

There have been multiple scientific studies that have been done to determine whether or not prayer is effective in healing.

{{quote|In fact, there was already a similar prayer study under way in 2001. This one involved 799 patients in an American coronary care unit. Half of them unknowingly received 'intercessory prayer' from groups of healers for twenty-six weeks, and the other half received no such prayers. The number of deaths, heart attacks, and other serious complications were similar in both groups, which implied that prayers were having no effect.|Singh, Simon|Trick or Treatment pp. 228-229}}

{{quote|And, in 2006, the results of a ten-year study costing $2.5 million were published by researchers studying the effect of prayer on over 1,000 cardiac bypass surgery patients at six American medical centers, including Harvard and the Mayo Clinic. Christian groups prayed for half the patients for several years, while the other half received no such prayers. Again, the average outcome was the same for both groups implying that prayers were ineffective.|Singh, Simon|Trick or Treatment p. 229}}

==Evidence==

The miracles depicted in the scripture are often produced as evidence for the divinity of its claims. And it is often required that believers of today have the same level of faith in the divine as the believers of the first century, even though the evidence each witnessed is different. 

{{quote|If miracles be necessary in one age to establish the truth of Christianity, they are equally necessary in every age. If one country be favoured with supernatural proofs, all other countries are equally entitled to the same unequivocal, convincing, and demonstrative testimony.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. 186}}

{{quote|But admitting, for the sake of a case, that something has been revealed to a certain person, and not revealed to any other person, it is a revelation to that person only. When he tells it to a second person, a second to a third, a third to a fourth, and so on, it ceases to be a revelation to all those persons. It is a revelation to the first person only, and hearsay to every other, and consequently, they are not obliged to believe it.|Paine, Thomas|The Age of Reason p. 7}}

If the claims made by the scriptures were not so grandiose, the evidence required to believe them would not need to be as equally grandiose.

{{quote|In general, the more extraordinary any event appears to be, the more evidence we require of it.|Priestley, Joseph|An History of Corruption on Christianity p. 450}}

There is not sufficient evidence from the nature of things to take the word of the writers at face value, especially given that most them were not eyewitnesses to the events they wrote about. 

{{quote|Scholars generally agree that the Gospels were written forty to sixty years after the death of Jesus. They thus do not present eyewitness or contemporary accounts of Jesus’ life and teachings.|[http://adversusapologetica.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/why-scholars-doubt-the-traditional-authors-of-the-gospels/ Why Scholars Doubt the Traditional Authors of the Gospel]|Oxford Annotated Bible p. 1744}}

Furthermore, people who lived two thousand years ago believed many superstitious or faulty notions which have been proven wrong in the light of an increase in scientific knowledge. For example, they believed the earth to be flat and the sun to actually rise and fall each day.

{{quote|The proper parent of all superstition, and false religion, is, as I have observed ignorance of nature, and the true causes of events.|Priestley, Joseph|Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion p. 100}}

Visions and dreams are often claimed as a source of evidence for the truth of the scriptures however such evidence is often unreliable. Not every dream that an individual dreams is true. And it would be unequal to assert that only those dreams that Jesus appeared in were reliable and all others were unreliable. Visions or daytime hallucinations suffer from the same problem.

{{quote|Since then appearances are so capable of deceiving, and things not real have a strong resemblance to things that are, nothing can be more inconsistent than to suppose that the Almighty would make use of means, such as are called miracles, that would subject the person who performed them to the suspicion or being an imposter, and the person who related them to be suspected of lying, and the doctrine intended to be supposed thereby to be suspected as a fabulous invention.|Paine, Thomas|The Age of Reason p. 52}}

What is most disturbing is that there exists no logical proof for the existence of God in any scripture. Even the first verse of the Old Testament ''presupposes'' that God exists without any justification for such a proposition. 

{{quote|In the beginning ''God''...|Genesis 1:1}}

Attempts are usually made that use everything in existence as evidence for the existence of God: &quot;The evidence is all around us.&quot; However, everything as evidence never has and never will provide a satisfying answer to the skeptical man. Such grandiose evidence can equally be used for the existence of any deity that has ever been worshiped by man and does more to hurt the belief in one God than it does to help it. Furthermore, the existence of one thing or many things does not prove the existence of another.

==Personification==

In the scriptures there are many things that are personified -- even God. He described as having a visible appearance and positional presence and yet at the same time is said to be invisible and to have an everywhere presence. It is stated that he is not a man, but everywhere he is personified as one. The scriptures lack any definitive answer about what constitutes God because he is often described as what he is said not to be. The simplest explanation for it would be that God is the personification of nature or the personification of that property in nature whereby we came to exist whether it be chaos, chance, evolution, an intelligent mind, a supreme being, etc. In the same fashion that Satan does not actually exist, but is only the personification of evil, it could equally be said that God does not actually exist, and that he is only the personification of good.

{{quote|They who would advance in knowledge, and not deceive and swell themselves with a little articulated air, should lay down this as a fundamental rule, not to take words for things, nor suppose that names in books signify real entities in nature, till they can frame clear and distinct ideas of those entities.|Locke, John|The Conduct of the Understanding pp. 69-71}}

In the Greek Septuagint the Hebrew word Sheol was translated as Hades, the name for the underworld and abode of the dead in Greek mythology.

{{quote|But the opinions neither of Hebrews nor of heathens remained invarialy the same. And from the time of the captivity, more especially from the time of the subjection of the jews, first to the Macedonian empire, and afterwards to the Roman; as they had closer intercourse with pagans, they insensibly imbided many of their sentiments, particularly on those subjects whereon their law was silent, and wherein, by consequence, they considered themselves as at greater freedom. On this subject of a future state, we find considerable difference in the popular opinions of the Jews in our Savior's time, from those which prevailed in the days of the ancient prophets. As both Greeks and Roman's had adopted the notion, that the ghosts of the departed were susceptible both of enjoyment and of suffering. They were led to suppose a sort of retribution in that state, for their merit or demerit in the present. The Jews did not indeed adopt the Pagan fables on this subject; nor did they express themselves entirely in the same manner; but the general train of thinking in both came pretty much to coincide. The Greek hades they found well adapted to express the Hebrew Sheol. This they came to conceive as including different sorts of habitations for ghosts of different characters. And though they did not receive the terms Elysium of Elysian fields, as suitable appleiations for the regions peopled by good spirits, they took instead of them, as better adapted to their own theology, the garden of Eden, or Paradise, a name originally Persian, by which the word answering to gardne, especially when applied to Eden, had commonly been rendered by the seventy. To denote the same state, they sometimes used the phrase Abraham's bosom, a metaphor borrowed from the manner in which they reclined at meals.|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry pp. 71-72}}

No: bad as the Jews were, they never accused him of any such thing.|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry p. 226}}

{{quote|The Pharisees held, that the souls of the wicked were to be punished with perpetual punishment, and that there was appointed for them a perpetual prison.|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry p. 241}}

{{quote|If the doctrine of hell torments, is so well calculated to prevent sin, and promote holiness, why did not our Lord teach it to the Jews, who are allowed to have been a race of very wicked men?|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry pp. 266-267}}

{{quote|That the preaching of eternal torments in hell, is one of the principal causes which produce revivals of religion in the present day, will not be denied.|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry p. 278}}

{{quote|Nor do we find in those days, what is too obvious in these, the different sects all exerting themselves in every possible way, to secure the greatest number of converts to their different churches. A man must shut his eyes very close, who does not see through all this religious maneuvering.|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry p. 279}}

{{quote|The course which the apostles perused was open, manly, and dignified; and the doctrine they preached was glad tidings of great joy to all people. Their object, was not to save men from Gehenna or hell, but from ignorance, idolatry, licentiousness, and unbelief, and to instruct them in the knowledge and obedience of the one living and true God. But, the primary object of preaching in the present day, seems to be to save men from hell; to attach converts to some religious party, and enjoin on them to believe neither more or less, all the days of their lives, than is contained in the creed, which they subscribed to on their admission. |Balfour, Walter|Inquiry pp. 282-283}}

{{quote|Error is not good for men, either in life or in death. It is truth which gives true hope and joy to the mind, and it is truth, which is a light to the feet and a lamp to the path.|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry p. 290}}

{{quote|It will not be denied, that a great many who are believers in the doctrine of hell torments have received this doctrine by tradition from their fathers, without any Scriptual examination of it for themselves.|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry p. 298}}

{{quote|You hear men every day call themselves Calvinists: but Calvinism now is a very different thing from what is found in the works of John Calvin. You also hear of orthodoxy, but orthodoxy is not the same now that it was twenty years ago, and what is true or orthodoxy in America, would not be orthodoxy in Scottland. The truth is, men are beginning to search the Scriptures for themselves, and are taking the liberty to dissent from their fathers, however learned, or good they may have been. The Reformation was the dawn of the day, after the long night of ignorance and superstition. But were the reformers to rise from the tomb, they would be surprised to see some good, some wise, and learned men, contending that we must advance no farther, but must sit down satisfied where they left us. Happy for us, that we live in an age and in a part of the world, where it would not be in the power of man to stop the tide of inquiry and investigation.|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry p. 299}}

{{quote|Evidence is the criterion of truth; nor can a man be said to believe any doctrine, farther than he understands it, and preceives the evidence of its truth. Where the evidence for or against any doctrine is equally balanced, the mind is in doubt, and suspense prevails, until some additional evidence appears, which leads the mind to preponderate to the one side or the other.|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry p. 300}}

{{quote|Is the belief that hell is a place of endless misery, which saves any man? And is it unbelief in this doctrine which damns any man to this punishment? here seems to be one radical mistake of the objector. He seems to think that if his doctrine is true, all who have not believed it, must suffer this punishment for not believing it.|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry p. 302}}

{{quote|But the first to condemn others, are generally the last to examine for themselves, what is truth on any religious subject.|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry p. 328}}

{{quote|For on the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, the doctrine of future punishment is founded. This doctrine among the heathen nations, could not exist without the immortality of the soul.|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry p. 341}}

===Universalism, the doctrine of the Bible===

{{quote|It is plain that in the Old Testament the ''most profound silence is observed'' in regard to the state of the deceased, their joy or sorrow, their happiness or misery.|Moore, Asher|Universalism, the doctrine of the Bible p. 103}}

{{quote|Besides, it should be well understood and never forgotten, that the Gospel is expressly called a new and better covenant than the legal, because established upon better promises--and not because it reveals dreadful and horrible evils that were altogether unknown to the old dispensation.|Moore, Asher|Universalism, the doctrine of the Bible p. 105}}

===Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion===

{{quote|If the heathen philosophers became so ''vain in their imaginations'', when they speculated concerning the nature of ''God''.. much more did they wander in uncertainty and error, with respect to the doctrine of a ''future state'', concerning which, as I have observed, the light of nature gives us no information at all.|Priestly, Joseph|Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion pp. 202-203}}

{{quote|Hell is a bugbear of superstition, which has never answered, and never can answer, any valuable purpose even in preventing crimes.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 32}}

{{quote|It is neither in the upper nor lower regions; it is not in heaven nor in hell, that the origin of moral evil will be discovered; it is to be founded only among those intelligent beings who exist upon the earth. ''Man has created it, and man must destroy it''.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. 129}}

{{quote|What then constitutes a moral evil? It is the violation of a law of justice or utility, by any one of the human species, competent to distinguish between right and wrong.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. 129}}

===Other Books===

{{quote|The primary religion of mankind arises chiefly from an anxious fear of future events; and what ideas will naturally be entertained of invisible, unknown powers, while men lie under dismal apprehensions of any kind, may easily be conceived. Every image of vengeance, severity, cruelty, and malice must occur, and must augment the ghastliness and horror which oppresses the amazed religionist. ... And no idea of perverse wickedness can be framed, which those terrified devotees do not readily, without scruple, apply to their deity.|Hume, David|The Natural History of Religion, section XIII}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3623">Excerpts from ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello'' from Eric Berne:

{{quote|The destiny of every human being is decided by what goes on inside his skull when he is confronted with what goes on outside his skull... Each person decides in early childhood how he will live and how he will die, and that plan, which he carries in his head wherever he goes, is called his ''script''.|Berne, Eric|What Do You Say After You Say Hello p. 31}}

{{quote|Although men are not laboratory animals, they often behave as though they are. Sometimes they are put in cages and treated like rats, manipulated and sacrificed at the will of their masters. But many times the cage has an open door, and a man has only to walk out if he wishes. If he does not, it is usually his ''script'' which keeps him there. That is familiar and reassuring, and after looking out at the great world of freedom with all its joys and dangers, he turns back to the cage with its buttons and levers, knowing that if he keeps busy pushing them, and pushes the right one at the right time, he will be assured of food, drink, and an occasional thrill. But always, such a caged person hopes or fears that some force greater than himself, the '''Great Experimenter''' or the '''Great Computer''', will change or end it all.|Berne, Eric|What Do You Say After You Say Hello p. 56}}

{{quote|For small children, there is usually some sort of Santa Claus who is watching their behavior and keeping the accounts. But he is for the &quot;little kids,&quot; and &quot;big kids&quot; don't believe in him, at least not in Santa Claus as a man in a masquerade costume who comes on a certain day of the year. In fact, not believing in that kind of Santa Claus is what separates big kids from the little ones, along with the knowledge of where babies come from. But big kids, and grownups too, have their own versions of Santa, each one different... In fact, most people spend their lives waiting for Santa Claus, or for some member of his family. 
And then there is his opposite number down below. Where '''Santa''' himself is a jolly man in a red suit who comes from the North Pole brining gifts, his opposite number is a grim man in a black cloak who comes from the South Pole carrying a scythe, and his name is '''Death'''. Thus the human race is split during later childhood into the Life Crowd, who will spend their lives waiting for Santa Claus, and the Death Crowd, who will spend their lives waiting for Death. These are the basic illusions on which all scripts are based: that either Santa Claus will come eventually brining gifts for the winners, or Death will come eventually and solve all the problems for the losers. Thus the first question to ask about illusions is, &quot;Are you waiting for Santa Claus, or Death?&quot;
But before the '''Final Gift''' (immortality) or the '''Final Solution''' (death), there are meanwhile others. Santa can bestow a winning lottery ticket, a life pension, or prolonged youth. Death can bestow a permanent disability, a cessation of sexual desire, or premature old age, each of which relives the person of some of his duties...|Berne, Eric|What Do You Say After You Say Hello p. 148}}

People are either waiting for their problems to be fixed by ''The Great Experimenter'' or ''The Great Computer''. The Great Experimenter is similar to God, who like Santa Claus, promises a Final Gift of immortality to cure the woes of life and human nature. The Great Computer is Death, who, when the clock runs out, provides the Final Solution: cessation of life and it's problems. The point is not to wait for &quot;forces greater than yourself&quot; to solve life's problems.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3133">Based on the quote from Attacking Faulty Reasoning I've surmised a couple of rules of incompatible premises.

{{quote|Another structural feature of an argument that could render it fatally flawed would be one whose premises are ''incompatible'' with one another. And an argument that has such premises is one from which ''any conclusion, no matter how outrageous, can be drawn''.|T. Edward Damer|Attacking Faulty Reasoning}}

''Rule 1: Whenever there exist an argument with two incompatible premises, there will also exist two corresponding incompatible conclusions.''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | ''Proposition''
|-
| Premise 1
| A
|-
| Premise 2
| NOT A
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | ''Conclusion''
|-
| Conclusion 1
| A
|-
| Conclusion 2
| NOT A
|}

In other words, whenever an argument contains a contradiction in its premises, it will naturally also contain a contradiction in its conclusion; conflicting premises will result in conflicting conclusions. In the table above there exists two premises that contradict one another and also two conclusions that contradict each other that when taken together are both simultaneously the conclusion to the proposition. Even with arguments where it is apparent there is a contradiction, it may not always be apparent that the contradiction can result in a conclusion other than the one being advocated for.

''Rule 2: Whenever there exists an argument with two incompatible premises, any compatible premises are irrelevant to the conclusion.''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | ''Proposition''
|-
| Premise 1
| A
|-
| Premise 2
| NOT A
|-
| Premise 3
| B
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | ''Conclusion''
|-
| Conclusion 1
| A
|-
| Conclusion 2
| NOT A
|}

In other words, whenever an argument contains a contradiction, its conclusion will be contradictory regardless of any additional premises. It makes no difference what side of the contradiction the additional premises are on: the argument still results in a contradiction.

''Rule 3: Whenever there exists an argument with two incompatible premises, any subpremises to the contradicting premises are irrelevant to the conclusion.''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | ''Proposition''
|-
| Premise 1
| A
|-
| Premise 1 Subpremise 1
| AA
|-
| Premise 2
| NOT A
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | ''Conclusion''
|-
| Conclusion 1
| A
|-
| Conclusion 2
| NOT A
|}

In other words, whenever an argument contains a contradiction, any subpremises that add additional support to either contradicting premise are irrelevant to the resulting conclusion. The subpremise to a contradicting premise may add additional support for that contradicting premise, but it is not relevant to the conclusion of the argument which ends up in a contradiction.

''Rule 4: Whenever there exists an argument with incompatible premises, each contradicting conclusion is equally valid or contradictory as the others.''

In other words, if there is presented an argument that has a contradiction, either side of the contradiction is an equally valid conclusion to the argument. One side of the contradiction can be as equally contradictory as the other side.

{{quote|This book is said to be given by divine inspiration; but is it possible that inspiration can be either transferred, translated, altered, or revised? Certainly the very nature of the thing forbids it... If it were binding on the first persons who received it, it could not be equally so upon the second, for the nature and force of the communications were essentially destroyed. The first power that communicated was divine, the second was human; the first was incapable of error, the second deceptive and fellacious.|Carlile, R|Principles of nature pp. 21-22}}

{{quote|To render this system correct, it is not only necessary that the first prophets and apostles should have been inspired, but that all the translators, transcribers, printers, and printer's boys, should have been inspired too.|Carlile, R|Principles of nature p. 22}}

{{quote|If inspiration be a thing found in truth, there can be no occasion to alter or revise it. It is defect alone that creates the necessity of alteration and revision.|Carlile, R|Principles of nature p. 22}}

{{quote|Therefore, if the Bible was right at first, every alteration is a deviation from that rectitude; and consequently, in proportion as the scriptures have been altered and revised in modern times, the Christian believer has been led astray; he has not believed in the real and true word of God.|Carlile, R|Principles of nature p. 22}}</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11523">The doctrine of ''original sin'' is the notion that the ''nature'' of man changed when Adam and Eve disobeyed God in the garden of Eden and partook of the forbidden fruit. This event is often referred to as the ''fall of man'' and because of it all mankind is said to be in a fallen state and liable to God for it. 

{{quotation|Now the doctrine that, in consequence of the sin of another, man is brought into the world with a nature so totally depraved that he cannot possibly do anything that is right, his understanding so darkened that he cannot discern the plainest truths in the Bible, and yet that he is held responsible for the commission of sin - threatened with the pains of hell unless he does what he has no power to do, and understands what he has no ability to understand - is a doctrine which never seemed to me quite right.|Dana, Mary|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 105}}

==Perfect Nature==

God is said to have created the first man and woman upright &lt;ref&gt;Ecclesiastes 7:29&lt;/ref&gt; and good &lt;ref&gt;Genesis 1:31&lt;/ref&gt;. The Christian system improves upon that characterization and ''implies'' that Adam and Eve were created immortal beings or holy apparitions and as such were perfect in every way. 

{{quote|A man who, its advocates say, God created upright, free from every kind of impurity, and placed in a state of uniform happiness, with a strong natural propensity to practice of every virtue, and an equally strong aversion to every vicious and immoral principle; created in the image of God himself, and possessing an unqualified attachment to celestial purity and goodness... nevertheless, transgressed the divine law, and this solitary violation [became] temporarily and eternally fatal to the human race.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature pp. 28-29}}

{{quote|An ingenious writer says, who were those men that lived in so much innocence? The first man who was born into the world, killed the second. ''When did the times of simplicity begin?'' And we may go back one step farther, and say, the first man that ever lived in the world, exhibited imperfection of his nature in the very act of sinning. ''When did the perfection and immaculate holiness of human nature begin?''|Moore, Asher|Universalism, the doctrine of the Bible p. 58}}

{{quote|But how or by what means perfect beings [Adam and Eve] could be deceived is not easily imagined-- and surely the fact affords but sorry proof of perfection!|Moore, Asher|Universalism, the doctrine of the Bible p. 61}}

The nature of the first male and female are so highly esteemed by the system that it borders on ancestor worship. If it is granted that they were born in a state of perfection, it would then become impossible for them to have disobeyed God; seeing that perfected beings cannot commit acts of imperfection, or do acts contrary to their own nature.

==Sin Nature==

That first act of imperfection, known as the first or original ''sin'', is said to to have been passed down from generation to generation through our ''nature''. And as a consequence, every man since the first is born with a ''sin nature'' or ''sinful nature''. How such a transference is realized without sin being a tangible substance is unclear.

{{quote|Sin is no more a substance than friendliness, goodness, or virtue are substances. If sin is a substance that can be transmitted physically, then virtue also must be a substance that can be transmitted physically. And what would be the result if all this were true? Why, sinners would beget sinners, and saints, of course, would beget saints!|GospelTruth.net}}

The notion that sin is a substance or is anything more than a physical act, only serves to mystify rather than clear the understanding.

{{quote|Sin is an act, and so it is impossible for it to be passed on physically..|GospelTruth.net}}

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;Sin is a conscious, willful act performed by an individual (in word, deed, or thought) that opposes God's will... it is an immoral choice made by the sinner, that transgresses God's law. Therefore apart from the sinner who makes the choice, then commits the act, sin can not even exist.

Yet theologians persist in the belief, more fit for a science fiction script than the Scriptures, that sin has been passed on physically from Adam to all his descendants, yet fail to tell us:

a) Why it is that we can only inherit sin from Adam but not from the rest of our ancestors.
b) Why it is that we can inherit sin but not inherit righteousness.
c) How it is that Adam's sin can come through our parents even if they are true Christians and therefore, in the words of the apostles John and Paul, have been cleansed from all sin.&lt;/poem&gt;|InPlainSight|[http://www.inplainsite.org/html/original_sin_fact_or_fable.html Original sin, fact or fable]}}

==Justice==

Even if it is granted that man is born with a sin nature and that such a nature is odious to God, it still doesn't answer the question of why he is condemned for circumstances out of his control. Man cannot choose the color of the skin he is born with much less the nature of it.

{{quote|We have no choice in the matter of our birth...|GospelTruth.net}}

{{quote|Is man to become a criminal before he has existed?|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 29}}

Rather, being born with a sin nature actually provides justification for any sins we might commit.

{{quote|If we were born with a sinful nature not one sin would be against our nature but every sin would agree with and be in harmony with our nature.&quot;|Overstreet, A. T.|[http://www.gospeltruth.net/OS100bibleverses.htm Over 100 texts from the Bible that show the doctrine of original sin is Unbiblical and false]}}

{{quote|In fact the murderer, the rapist, and all other sinners have a ''perfect and legitimate excuse'' for all their sins if they were born with a sinful nature.|GospelTruth.net}}

{{quote|Moreover, the wicked would by this means be exonerated; because it would indicate the depravity which was innate in them, and not their own acquired criminality.|Racovian Catechism p. 328}}

Even today it is often thought that man has a spirit, a soul, and a body; but what constitutes a spirit and a soul and how they are different is mere speculation. Such an idealistic view of the nature of man, opens the doors and the windows for the speculators to enter in. And once they enter in, they will conjure up many mystical notions which will be there long after they are gone. How a man can be born with a sin nature, and why God condemns him for being thus born, we will leave to the speculators to answer.

==Scriptures==

No where in the scriptures does it ''explicitly'' lay out the doctrine of original sin. Rather, it was the works of the early church Fathers who generally ''inferred'' it from a couple of verses found in Romans. The creation story in Genesis also lacks any mention of the nature of man being changed as a result of Adam's disobedience.

The notion of what constitutes the ''nature'' of man often been ''mystified'', primarily during the times when mankind knew very little about the human body. Most people who contend that mankind has a ''sinful nature'' do not have a concrete idea of what that actually means.

{{quote|The word ''nature'' in the Bible, when it refers to our birth, ''never refers to a sinful nature''. This is shown in Rom. 2:14, which says: &quot;For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law...&quot; Now the word nature in this text does refer to the nature we receive at birth. But it is evident that the word nature used here is not a sinful nature. For how would a sinful nature ever cause us to &quot;do by nature the things contained in the law&quot;? A sinful nature would not cause us to do the things contained in the law a sinful nature would only cause us to commit sin!|GospelTruth.net}}

In other words, the nature a man has is based on what he does and not the state in which he was born. When it is said that a man has a &quot;kind-hearted nature&quot;, it doesn't mean that he was born with kindness in his heart, but rather that he acts in a manner that is kind toward others. Any kind of sinful nature that a man could have would be based on his actions of sin. Once such a man stopped sinning, it would not be proper to say that he still had a sinful nature. Similarly in the scriptures, the term ''divine nature'' is used to describe those men who did the works of the divine. 

===Calvinism===

One of the five points of Calvinism is the total depravity of man; that man is so fully consumed with his sinful nature that he cannot even help himself.

{{quote|According to Calvinism, they cannot help themselves. They cannot repent and turn to God, as the Scriptures command &quot;all men, everywhere,&quot; to do. What a mockery does this system make of the precious invitations which the gospel gives to &quot;every creature!&quot; If they are &quot;utterly indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all that is spiritually good,&quot; how can God entreat, aye, command them to become so? It is a bitter mockery to press the claims of the gospel upon those who are so utterly helpless.|Dana, Mary|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 110}}

In order to justify the rite of ''infant baptism'', Calvin even admits that infants are born with this whorish nature.

{{quote|Calvin says, that &quot;even infants bring their damnation with them from their mother's womb; for, although they have not yet produced the fruits of their iniquity, they have the seed of it enclosed within them. Nay, their whole nature is, as it were, a seed of sin, so that it cannot be otherwise than odious and abominable to God.&quot;|Dana, Mary|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 112, Institutes of the Christian Religion John Calvin p. 483}}

==Conclusion==

The belief that mankind is totally depraved is essentially the belief in the invalidity of all men. A defeated view of humanity is propagated in every pulpit once a week with the hope that if the hearers come back next week, and the week after, ad infinitium, their nature will be changed over time and by that fact they will be saved; in other words the priests have the solution to the problem they originally created - how marvelous! The notion that the first man was endowed with a ''mysterious'' nature, that ''mysteriously'' absorbed the stain of sin and passed it on to future generations, suggests that his nature was never stain resistant or perfect in the first place. 

{{quote|Christianity has taught [man] two awful and destructive lessons; first, that he is incapacitated for the performance of moral actions; and secondly, in case he ''should'' perform them, they would add no merit or superior excellence to his character; that his best righteousness is like filthy rags which God would treat with marked abhorrence.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. p. 116}}

In psychology original sin is essentially the ''life position'' of, &quot;I'm - Not OK, You're - Not OK, and They're - Not OK&quot;. 

{{quote|This is the pessimistic position of cynics or of those who believe in predestination and original sin.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;We are none of us any good anywhere.&quot;|Berne, Eric|What Do You Say After You Say Hello? p. 91}}

It is clear all throughout the book of Ecclesiastes that the writer suffers from the very same depressive life position. And it culminates in the verse,

{{quote|Indeed, there is no one on earth who is righteous, no one who does what is right and never sins.|Ecclesiastes 7:20 NIV}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2456">Note: Below are some of the conclusions I've come to based on experience.

It is difficult to rationally discuss topics where ''personal'' belief might be introduced into a conversation. The primary source of contention is always the psychological nature of the belief held by the individual. It is the degree with which the individual identifies with the belief that distinguishes it from being able to be discussed rationally or not. If we consider a ''belief'' to be a conclusion an individual has arrived at, then a ''personal belief'' could be considered the identification of one's self with that conclusion. Any opposition that might be raised toward the personal belief of an individual is perceived not as an objection to the validity of the belief, but rather as an attack on the identity of the individual who holds it. Losing an argument for the validity of a personally held belief is tantamount to losing one's own identity and can produce cognitive dissonance. In this way personal beliefs are held dogmatically even though they might not be promoted fanatically. The more the individual identifies with the particular belief, the harder it is for them to objectively analyze it. Likewise, the more reliant the individual's identity is upon the belief, the more dogmatically they will hold to it.

The two topics that are most notability ones where people have ''personal beliefs'' are politics and religion.

{{quote|&quot;Political beliefs are like religious beliefs in the respect that both are part of who you are and important for the social circle to which you belong,&quot; said lead author Jonas Kaplan, an assistant research professor of psychology at the Brain and Creativity Institute at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. &quot;To consider an alternative view, you would have to consider an alternative version of yourself.&quot;|Gersema, Emily|[http://news.usc.edu/114481/which-brain-networks-respond-when-someone-sticks-to-a-belief/ Which brain networks respond when someone sticks to a belief?]}}

The fact that people ''identify'' themselves with a particular political party or religious sect is the exact reason why they aren't able to objectively discuss either topic to various degrees. The stronger they view themselves as a member of a particular sect, the harder is it for them to see that alternative version of themself. The psychological phenomenon that breeds this type of sectarian thinking is called groupthink.</text>

The truth that religion claims is often ''mysterious'' in nature or beyond human comprehension. By this token, religion can claim any absurdity to be true so long as it is a work of God.

{{quote|When men, whether from policy or pious fraud, set up systems of religion ''incompatible'' with the word or works of God in the creation, and not only above, but ''repugnant'' to human comprehension, they were under the necessity of inventing or adopting a word that should serve as a bar to all questions, inquiries and speculations. The word mystery answered this purpose; and thus it has happened that religion, which is in itself without mystery, has been corrupted into a fog of mysteries.|Paine, Thomas|The age of reason p. 50}}

Religion can never be the determining factor in deciding what is true or false. Many illogical propositions have been asserted to be true by religion that when confronted are always answered with: it is not illogical, it is beyond human logic.

{{quote|Truth, in matters of religion, is simply the opinion that has survived.|Wilde, Oscar}}

==Superstition==

The belief in the ''supernatural'' system proposed by religion has led to many superstitions. In fact, the belief in supernatural ''beings'' and ''forces'' is the basis for all superstitions. All superstitions are marked by a lack of universal and repeatable evidence to support their claims. It is Christianity that has converted belief in propositions that lack evidence into a ''virtue'' called ''faith''. There is essentially no difference between blind belief or faith in a religious notion and blind belief or faith in a superstitious notion. It is only the consistency of nature that can provide universal and repeatable evidence for the truth about any proposition concerning the nature of things.

{{quote|No doctrine ought to be believed because it is asserted by the learned, and professed by the multitude; but on the evidence whereby it is supported.|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry p. 107}}

{{quote|All truths are consistent with one another.|Priestley, Joseph|Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion p. 412}}

Superstition is the result of an incorrect association between cause and effect; an effect is seen in nature and it is attributed to a supernatural being because there exists a gap of knowledge about the natural world. The only way to combat superstition is with scientific knowledge which is reproducible and consistent. In other words, the only way to rid ourselves of incorrect cause and effect associations is to educate ourselves as to what are the true causes of effects seen in nature.

{{quote|The witches of antiquity have fled to the mountains; the prophets are no longer credited, and the possibilitiy of miracles is not admitted by the mathematical and physical reasoner.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 71}}

==Miracles==

The evidence whereby religious dogmas are supported are ''violations of the laws of nature'' called miracles. These miracles are one time, non-reproducible incursions into the natural world by supernatural forces. 

{{quote|Here are, then, two kinds of evidence opposed to each other; the one human experience, and the other human testimony.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 67}}

{{quote|If we say that we believe the former extravagent accounts, we contradict the testimony of our own senses; we abandon the instructive guide of our own experience, and affirm that the testimony of a few men has more weight than our own positive knowledge.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 69}}

{{quote|If miracles were necessary to establish Christianity in the first instance, they are equally proper and necessary now; ''for proofs ought to be equal to all, where equal credence is demanded''. To make the Christian religion consistent, it is necessary there should be a constant string of miracles in every age and in all countries; but this would destroy the very nature of miracles, by making them so frequent, that it would be impossible to distinguish between these events, and those which were produced by the common operations of the laws of Nature. It is, therefore, impossible to give equal proof to all those who are equally interested in the ultimate decision upon revealed religion.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature p. 72}}

There is no good reason why the report of a person who has witnessed a miracle should be believed at face value. Furthermore there does not appear to be any way to distinguish between the report of a sane man and one who only speaks insanity; because both speak of truly incredible things. It is more likely that the true causes of miracles are hallucinations, delusions, or other environmental influences.

{{quote|No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavors to establish.|Hume, David}}

==Sectarianism==

The belief in political and religious dogmas has often divided mankind. Religion has probably led to more divisions among men than any other force and often the faithful look to this division as to confirmation of their own righteousness and the righteousness of their god.  

{{quote|The most detestable wickedness, the most horrid cruelties, and greatest miseries, that have afflicted the human race, have had their origin in this thing called revelation, or revealed religion.|Paine, Thomas|The age of reason p. 145}}

The history of the church and religion in general has shown that as scientific knowledge increased, errors were discovered in the dogmas and doctrines, which gave rise to even further churches, religions, and sects.

{{quote|The sectarian divisions are so numerous, that it is impossible to determine which is the true church. They continually dispute with each other concerning the truth of their doctrine, they anathematize one another, and are liberal in the charges of heresy; they are all heretics in the estimation of each other, and they have no standard to determine with certitude their theological differences.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. 121}}

When the absurdity of multiple gods became evident, new religions were formed around the notion of one god. It was in this way that religion itself was modernized. It was an advancement of knowledge, the exposing of error and corruption, which brought about the transformation. Yet there still exists many religions where multiple gods are still worshiped. In every age where there was found in a error there were also those who were too ignorant to look at the evidence for themselves. There are many sects that are hundreds of years old that exist today only due to continued ignorance.

{{quote|Most people are just too damn lazy to look at evidence before they decide on what they think is true or not.|TommyPaine}}

{{quote|Every new sect discarded some of the absurdities of that from which it had separated, and passed a general sentiment of condemnation upon all those who were in the rear of this long and religious train.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. 240}}

{{quote|The different religious sectaries all reject each other's doctrines, and too frequently hate and detest each other on account of difference in opinions; while the scientific mind, rising above early prejudices, perceives the errors of all parties, and pities the ignorance, which binds man to such stupid and senseless doctrines.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. 211}}

'''Psychology'''

In Transactional Analysis, patterns of behavior that are borrowed from our parental figures are part of the Parent ego state. It is this ego state that often imbibes the religion or traditions held by our parents.

{{quote|In groups, this is most dramatically seen in religious or political fanatics, where the excluding Parent takes over all the pathways of expression, and rides roughshod over the Child and Adult as well as all the other members of the group.|Berne, Eric. M.D|What Do You Say After You Say Hello p. 366}}

In other words, in religious and political fanatics the patterns of behavior formed from parental traditions ride roughshod over any form of critical thinking or objective analysis.

==Fear==

The fear of death is a powerful motivator and religion uses it as a tool for growth and manipulation. Many successful marketing strategies utilize fear as its driving force and religion is no exception. Those who can calm our fears or pretend to have an answer to one of life's greatest questions can draw to themselves the pocketbooks of many disciples. It is necessary to ensure a positive cash-flow for the improvement or maintenance of any religion. If it were not for the willingness of individuals to donate money, religion would have fallen by the way-side as a rudimentary philosophy of the world written with the rudimentary knowledge of the ancients.

The height of fear marketing in Christianity was with the advent of hell-fire sermons. At the time, pastors all across Christendom ratcheted up rhetoric to market their product: everlasting life and salvation from everlasting fire. For a ''temporal'' fee, whether it be obedience or money, men were promised an ''eternal'' gift. It is the best product any marketer could have to sell as there is no obligation on the part of the seller to deliver what was actually promised; it is up to God's arbitrary will to deliver the goods.

{{quote|The idle and foolish stories of nurses, and the still more ruinous tales and doctrines of priests, are calculated only to corrupt the heart, and bury the human mind in the gulf of the most destructive prejudices.|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. 206}}

==Hope==

The promises of religion are the carrot and the stick that are used to keep followers obedient. The catch is that the carrot cannot be consumed in this life but only in the next. The potential loss of the promise causes fear while the hope of the promise causes comfort. Sadly, parishioners spend their entire lifetime hoping in promises without scientific evidence that those promises will ever be fulfilled in this life or the next. The only evidence of the fulfillment of any promises are stories written thousands of years ago by infantile man.

==Difference==

The belief in a supernatural system should make no difference in how men should live their lives. Nor is a belief in a god necessary for a moral life. If morals are dictated by religion shrouded in ''mystery'' there is the possibility of those morals being illogical and absurd.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20356">The doctrine of a ''principle of evil'' supposes there to be a supernatural being that fell from heaven who tempts mankind in the earth and torments their wicked souls in hell -- theologically referred to as the devil and person-ologically referred to by the name Satan. The word ''Satan'' that appears in the English scriptures is an untranslated Hebrew ''verb'' meaning to &quot;obstruct, oppose&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia. Satan, Hebrew Bible&lt;/ref&gt; It is left untranslated and capitalized as a proper name solely based on the bias of the translators; the ancient Hebrew written language made no distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters. 

== Garden of Eden ==
[[File:AdamEveSerpent2.jpg|right|200px|Adam and Eve]]
It is commonly believed that the serpent in the Garden of Eden represents the devil in some way or another, however, the only way to come to that belief is through ''inferring'' it into the creation narrative.

{{quote|No Old Testament writer says, Moses by the serpent, Genesis 3, meant a fallen angel...|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 21}}

There exists no ''explicit'' declaration that the serpent is even an angelic being. 

{{quote|Moses in no part of his writings, gives us any information about an angel who fell from heaven and had become a devil. Let any one read the five books of Moses, and he must be convinced that such a being is not once mentioned by him under any name.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 21}}

The ''most'' that the serpent could have been was a very cunning animal.

{{quote|Now the serpent was more cunning than any ''beast of the field'' which the Lord God had made.|Genesis 3:1 NKJV}}

No intimation is made that an evil being shape-shifted into a serpent or that the spirit of such a being inhabited a serpent. A stronger case can be made that the serpent was simply an animal that spoke in the same manner that a donkey did in Numbers 22:28.

However, if the serpent were a being of any kind it is strange that God never questioned it on account of its actions. Adam and Eve had to give an answer for what they had done, but the serpent never did. It is very possible that the serpent was not a being, but simply the ''personification'' of Eve's lust. 

{{quote|But each man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.|James 1:14}}

== Job ==

One of the more credible places where it is ''supposed'' that proof of the existence of an evil being appears in is the book of Job. And even though it may speak in poetical language and begin on the premise that an evil being exists, it doesn't mean that one actually does exist, or that it is promoting such a notion.

{{quote|Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.|Job 1:6 KJV}}

It is unclear whether the sons of God or the Adversary (also translated Satan) are angelic beings or men. There are many people who will contend one way or the other, however, all we can truly say for certain is,

{{quote|For as many as are led by the spirit of God, these are the sons of God.|Romans 8:14 YLT}}

The notion of there being an evil being actually existing came from the ancient philosophers who assigned good effects to good causes and evil effects to evil causes; or good effects to a ''principle of good'' called God and evil effects to a ''principle of evil'' called the devil. 

{{quote|Since nothing can come into being without a cause; and since that which is perfectly good cannot be the cause of evil, then there must exist a distinct principle in nature, as well for the production of evil as of that which is good.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 186}}

{{quote|This belief in good and evil powers had its origin in the fact that man was surrounded by what he was pleased to call good and evil phenomena. Phenomena affecting man pleasantly were ascribed to good spirits, while those affecting him unpleasantly or injuriously, were ascribed to evil spirits. It being admitted that all phenomena were produced by spirits, the spirits were divided according to the phenomena, and the phenomena were good or bad as they affected man. Good spirits were supposed to be the authors of good phenomena, and evil spirits of the evil - so the idea of a devil has been as universal as the idea of a god.|Ingersoll, Robert|The Gods and Other Lectures pp. 34-35}}

In the land of Uz, where Job was from, these where the philosophies of the day, but it wasn't the philosophy of Job who assigned the cause of all effects both good and evil to God.

{{quote|What, shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.|Job 2:10 KJV}}

When speaking of his afflictions Job says,

{{quote|The LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.|Job 1:21 KJV}}

And these concur with Isaiah 45:7,

{{quote|I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.|Isaiah 45:7 KJV}}

It is clear that Job never thought that the source or the originator of the events that caused all his afflictions to be anybody other than God even though it is ''presupposed'' in the first two chapters of the book that an ''Adversary'' was. 

{{quote|Indeed, we think it has been established, that the account of Satan in the first two chapters of Job, was introduced for the express purpose of refuting such opinions.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 65}}

The only ''Adversary'' that actually existed was God. God acted as an adversary to Job in order that Job might be tested; in a similar way that God acted as an adversary (or Satan) to David (see 1 Chronicles 21:1 and 2 Samuel 24:1 KJV).

== Isaiah 14:12 ==

It is often ''inferred'' that the Lucifier named in Isaiah 14:12 is in fact Satan.

{{quote|How art thou fallen from heaven, ''O Lucifer'', son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!|Isaiah 14:12 KJV}}

Below is commentary from Adam Clarke that provides reasonable exegesis regarding this passage. 

{{quote|''O Lucifer, son of the morning'' - The Versions in general agree in this translation, and render הילל (heilel) as signifying Lucifer, Φωσφωρος, the morning star, whether Jupiter or Venus; as these are both bringers of the morning light, or morning stars, annually in their turn. And although the context speaks explicitly concerning Nebuchadnezzar, yet this has been, I know not why, applied to the chief of the fallen angels, who is most incongruously denominated Lucifer, (the bringer of light!) an epithet as common to him as those of Satan and Devil. That the Holy Spirit by his prophets should call this arch-enemy of God and man the light-bringer, would be strange indeed. But the truth is, the text speaks nothing at all concerning Satan nor his fall, nor the occasion of that fall, which many divines have with great confidence deduced from this text. O how necessary it is to understand the literal meaning of Scripture, that preposterous comments may be prevented! Besides, I doubt much whether our translation be correct. הילל (heilel), which we translate Lucifer, comes from ילל (yalal), yell, howl, or shriek, and should be translated, &quot;Howl, son of the morning;&quot; and so the Syriac has understood it; and for this meaning Michaelis contends: see his reasons in Parkhurst, under הלל (halal).|Adam Clarke Commentary on Isaiah 14:12}}

Isaiah 14 is a &quot;parable against the king of Babylon&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 14:4 ASV&lt;/ref&gt; yet no where does it ''explicitly'' say that it is referring to a supernatural being. In fact, more modern translations entirely do away with the name Lucifier altogether.

{{quote|How art thou fallen from heaven, O day-star, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, that didst lay low the nations!|Isaiah 14:12 ASV}}

Furthermore, to say that the king or the kingdom of Babylon has &quot;fallen from heaven&quot; is to say that it has fallen from among the nations who had the most glory on the earth. No where in Isaiah 14 do the words Satan, devil, or angel occur -- those notions are all ''inferred'' into these passages.

== Revelations ==

The book of Revelations is thought to complete the story of Satan, fill in the missing pieces of the puzzle, and connecting the dots between the serpent and Satan.

{{quote|And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.|Revelations 12:9 KJV}}

If we take the verse above literally it is not difficult to see how such an interpretation could be made, but it is important to understand that that verse is not meant to be taken literally. In fact that verse and even the whole of Revelations is not a ''literal telling of past events'', but a ''figurative foretelling of future events''. The beginning of the book of Revelations confirms it,

{{quote|A revelation of Jesus Christ, that God gave to him, ''to shew to his servants what things it behoveth to come to pass quickly''; ''and he did signify [it]'', having sent through his messenger to his servant John|Revelations 1:1}}

Revelations is a ''sign'', a prophecy, of things to come -- but the story of the devil is said to have already happened before the creation. References  that are said to the chronicle the story of the devil in both Revelations and Isaiah are contained in prophecies. Yet prophecies foretell the future and the story of the devil is so far in the past that it is in the past before there was a past, it is said to be a creation before the creation, or a supernatural creation prior to all that is natural. The truth of the matter is that the great dragon, old serpent, and so called Devil and Satan mentioned in Revelations is simply the ''personification of evil'' not the story of a ''person or principle of evil''.

== The Tempter of Mankind ==

Satan is identified as ''the tempter'' in the Gospels &lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia. Satan.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is thought that he first tempted Eve, even tempted Jesus, and now goes around tempting all of mankind. But how can a ''natural'' being such as man resist the temptations of a ''supernatural'' being? Man has no inherent power where by he can resist a supernatural being, yet he is commanded by God to resist it. Even if a man were to flee, he cannot outrun a spirit.

{{quote|If pure mother Eve could not resist such a temptation, how can it be expected her corrupt offsprings can resist any temptation?&quot; |Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 26}}

Not only does Satan tempts every man, but he is said to be the source of all evil, even of the evil that exists in man. But if the devil is the cause of our evil thoughts and desires, then surely he must have the ability to inject that evil into our minds. Though it would seem strange that God would give such power to his adversary, over that of man, and yet unjustly require the consequence of the adversary's actions at the hand of man. 

{{quote|God must be very merciful to the devil, to excuse him so long a time from eternal misery, yet send all the Sodomites there when he burnt up their city.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 337}}

For the devil to be cause of every man's sin he must have a incredible power reviling that of God even the omnipresent ability to tempt multiple people simultaneously all around the globe. With all these powers the devil is ''supposed'' to have it is no wonder that,

{{quote|The devil, with many people, is much more feared than God.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 191}}

According to the scriptures, it is always the lusts of men which cause them to sin and not the devil.

{{quote|Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempteth no man: but each man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.|James 1:13-14 ASV}}

James 1:13-14 above is the clearest passage concerning the subject: it does not use parables, or prophecies, or even personification.

{{quote|Besides, when the Scriptures trace crimes to their source in plain language, they never refer them to the devil, but to lust within men.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 129}}

Over time the notion of an evil being lead some to believe that one actually existed and that belief changed the way they spoke about every source of evil, in that, everything became personified as the evil deity.

{{quote|Whatever is calculated to seduce men to sin, is represented by the sacred writers under the figure of a living agent, called the evil one-- the adversary--the enemy--the devil, and satan.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 164}}

By implying that the evil cause for all our evil effects is a supernatural being of great evil, we shift the blame away from ourselves and toward something which we are powerless to stop and in affect become helpless.

{{quote|From our mother Eve to the present day, all men who listen to the lies of their own lusts, contrary to God's commandments, have found that the ways of transgressors are hard. ... But while lust is the true cause of all the mischief, an imaginery being has been invented and believed in, to bear the blame of it.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 128-129}}

== Zoroastrianism == 

The theology that there exists a ''principle of evil'' named Satan warring against a ''principle of good'' called God is found in the far east religions even before the time of Christ.

{{quote|Some of the ancients, as the Persians, thought that there were two independent principles in nature, one the author of good, and the other of evil.|Priestley, Joseph|Discourses relating to the evidences of revealed religion p. 191}}

{{quote|The Persians then had one good being or god, and also one evil being. Or, as Prideaux observes, &quot;that is to say God and the devil.&quot; Christians in this are perfectly agreed with them, for they believe in one God and also one devil. Again; the Persians believed, that these two gods were the authors of all good and evil in the world. In this also Christians agree with them, for all good they ascribe to God, and impute all evil to Satan or the devil... But again, the Persians believed, that there was a continual opposition between their good god and evil god, and that this should continue to the end of the world. Then, the good god shall overcome the evil god, and thence-forward each of them shall have his world to himself, that is, the good god his world with all good men with him, and the evil god his world with all evil men with him. Christians contend, that there is a continual opposition between their God and the devil, and that this opposition shall continue to the end of the world. Then, God is to overcome the devil, and from that time hence-forward, God is to have his world and all good men with him, and the devil is to have his world, and all wicked men with him. Such are a few of the leading points of similarity between the ancient Magian faith and the faith of Christians in our day.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 60}}

{{quote|Some of the Persians thought, that there were two gods, of different natures, the one good, called Horomazes, and the other evil, called Arimanius, the one resembling light, and the other darkness; and that in the medium between these was Mithras, who was therefore called the Mediator.|Priestley, Joseph|Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit p. 317}}

And the Magian faith is the root of the Zoroastrian religion which was religion in Babylon which became Persia.

{{quote|The Jews were carried away to Babylon, and spent seventy years in captivity. Here, the Magian religion, revived and improved by Zoroaster, prevailed|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 66}}

In Babylon the Jews first learned and were lead to believe that there existed a god who was the source of all woes apart from God Almighty. And as can be seen in the New Testament, the Jews even after having returned to the land of Israel, still ascribed evil effects to an evil supernatural being which is translated as Satan.

{{quote|The fact is, the Jews knew nothing about the devil until they went to Babylon.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 116}}

And while those beliefs may have existed at some point among the unlearned Jews, the belief in a devil is not part of the Jewish religion.

{{quote|In mainstream Judaism there is no concept of a devil like in mainstream Christianity or Islam. Texts make no direct link between the serpent that tempts Eve in the Garden of Eden from Genesis and references to a Satan in the first book of Chronicles and in Job. In Hebrew, the biblical word ha-satan (השָׂטָן) means &quot;the adversary&quot; or the obstacle, or even &quot;the prosecutor&quot; (recognizing that God is viewed as the ultimate Judge)|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil#Judaism Devil]|Wikipedia}}

== Superstition ==

The belief in the existence of the power of the occult has become to be regarded as superstitious and Satan is part of that system.  

{{quote|The horrors of witchcraft were all born of an ignorant belief in the existence of a totally depraved being superior to nature, acting in perfect independence of her laws; and all religious superstition has had for its basis a belief in at least two beings, one good and the other bad, both of whom could arbitrarily change the order of the universe.|Ingersoll, Robert|The Gods and Other Lectures pp. 60-61}}

{{quote|But while people are generally agreed that witchcraft was all a piece of superstition and do justice to the devil in freeing him from all blame about it, yet they still continue to believe in his existence and extraordinary powers... Strange, beyond measure strange, that our fathers should so completely discard witchcraft as a superstition which the Jews imbibed from the Canaanites, where no devil was known, and yet continue to believe in the devil, a superstition which the Jews imbibed at Babylon many ages after.|Balfour, Walter|Three Inquiries p. 179}}

{{quote|How is it possible that man should have any clear conceptions of natural truth, when his understanding is constantly insulted with a thousand incongruous and nonexistent relations, such as ghosts, witches, and devils, which perpetually disturb the imagination, and draw the rational faculties into the vortex of fancy and fanaticism?|Palmer, Elihu|Principles of nature Gb. 206-207}}

== Difficulties ==

[[File:HitlerManEater.jpg|left|150px|Hitler depicted in WW2 propaganda poster]][[File:DocIran.png|thumbnail|First step to war is demonization of the enemy &lt;ref&gt;Documentary, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzCDdXkwe28 Iran is Not The Problem]&lt;/ref&gt;]]In our present day it is difficult for some to accept the possibility that Satan does not exist - to the point that many would say that it is impossible for God to exist without Satan. One of the causes for this may be because a belief in the devil and demons are highly ingrained in the common philosophy and speech of the world. This can be clearly seen by our demonization of our enemies. 

{{quote|The characterization of an individual or/and group as an enemy is called ''demonization''. The propagation of demonization is a major aspect of ''propaganda''. An &quot;enemy&quot; may also be conceptual; used to describe impersonal phenomena such disease, and a host of other things. Throughout religious theology, &quot;the Enemy&quot; is typically reserved to represent the human tendency to do evil, often personified as a malicious deity, such as the devil or a demon.|Wikipedia|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enemy Enemy]}}

In the middle east, the United States is often seen as the Great Satan and the United States often sees every Arab as a demon or terrorist. Some of the enemies of the United States that have been demonized include Hitler, Castro, Chavez, Saddam Hussein, Ahmadinejad, etc. And the demon propaganda makes it that much more difficult to determine the truth concerning the actual character of these public individuals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17032">The philosophy of the ''soul'' supposes that there exists with-in man an immaterial spirit that existed prior to the creation of his body and will continue to exist long after the destruction of it. 

{{quotation|I had always taken it for granted, that man had a soul distinct from his body.|Priestley, Joseph.|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] iii}}

==Causes for Doubt==

# What is the exact nature of a soul?
# How can an immaterial spirit interact with a material body?
# Why doesn't the soul float away if it is distinct from the body?

==Origin==

Ancient philosophers through observation of the body at death ''supposed'' that a person's invisible character was released through the body's final exhalation. The natural process of the body exhaling its last breath became the supernatural ethereal spirit or soul releasing itself from the body. It is from this supposition that the common idiom &quot;he gave up the ghost&quot; comes.

{{quote|What the ancients meant by an immaterial substance [or spirit] being nothing more than an ''attenuated matter'', like ''air'', ''ether'', ''fire'', or ''light'', considered as fluids, beyond which their idea ''incorporeity'' did not go.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 212}}

{{quote|The ablest and most orthodox christian Fathers, he says, always say that God is a ''light'', and a ''sublime light'', and that all the celestial powers which surround the Deity are ''lights of a second order'', ''rays of the first light''.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 223}}

{{quote|The idea of invisible forces and invisible spirits might have risen from the sight of ''winds'' coming out of nowhere and ''lightning bolts'' from the blue. Our forefathers were not aware of static air, as they could not perceive it by any of our senses. Therefore, when air began to move around they naturally assumed that it was some invisible, living force at work... Man was projecting his own nature on these invisible forces.|William, Xavier|World Religions KL 924-926, 929}}

{{quote|Another widespread belief concerning ghosts is that they are composed of a misty, airy, or subtle material. Anthropologists link this idea to early beliefs that ghosts were the person within the person (the person's spirit), most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person's ''breath'', which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist. This belief may have also fostered the metaphorical meaning of &quot;breath&quot; in certain languages.|Wikipedia|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost Ghosts]}}

{{quote|Mankind have always been [very ready] to ascribe the unknown cause of extraordinary appearances to something to which they can give the name spirit.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 210}}

The logical conclusion then was that there existed both good and bad spirits according to the character or disposition of the person from which they came. Wicked men were said to release a wicked spirit and righteous men were said to release a righteous spirit. 

{{quote|Nevertheless, Josephus says that &quot;demons are the spirits of wicked men, who enter the living, and kill those who receive no help:&quot; language too clear and express to be perverted by the power of criticism.|Farmer, Hugh|An essay on the demoniacs of the New Testament p. 25}}

{{quote|It is no inconsiderable confirmation of all that hath been offered concerning possessing demons, that the primitive Christian understood hereby human spirits, and represent this as the general opinion of the world.|Farmer, Hugh|An essay on the demoniacs of the New Testament p. 28}}

Believing these spirits to then have supernatural powers, men began venerating them.

==Matter==

The ancients philosophers, based on their belief in spirit, supposed that the origin of all existence was either of spirit or of matter. 

{{quote|Such a distinction as the ancient philosophers did make between matter and spirit... made the ''Supreme Mind'' the author of all good, and ''matter'' the source of all evil, that all inferior intelligences are ''emanations'' from the ''Supreme Mind'', or made out of its substance, and that ''matter'' was reduced to its present form not by the Supreme Mind itself, but by another intelligence, a peculiar emanation from it, has been the real source of the greatest corruptions of true religion in all ages, many of which remain to this very day.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. iii}}

Those beings that were spirit, having great powers, were esteemed. Those beings that were matter, having only their natural powers, were abhorred. Everything that was spirit was thought to be holy and pure and everything that was matter was thought to be fleshly and defiled.

{{quote|The more unnatural anything is, the more it is capable of becoming the object of dismal admiration.|Paine, Thomas|The age of reason p. 13}}

==Commonality==

The prevailing notion concerning the constitution of the soul is that it is incorporeal or immaterial. The difficultly with this supposition is in defining how the soul and the body interact with one another seeing they have no properties in common.

{{quote|The modern doctrines of immateriality have generally contended themselves with supposing, that there is some ''unknown real influence'' between the soul and the body, but that the connection is a ''mystery'' to us. And this is not the first absurdity, and impossibility, that has found a convenient shelter under that term.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] 84}}

{{quote|To say, in general, that matter and spirit must have some common property, but that this common property is altogether ''unknown'' to us, cannot give any satisfaction. For till it be defined, I am at liberty to say, that such unknown common property may be impossible in nature.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] xxvi}}

If the soul or spirit be immaterial and the body be material, there is nothing preventing the one from flying away from the other.

{{quote|It is contended for by all metaphysicians, who maintain the doctrine of any ''proper immaterial principle'', that ''spirit'' and ''body'' can have no ''common property''; and when it is asked, How, then can they ''act upon one another'', and how can they be so intimately connected as to be continually and necessarily subject to each other's influence? It is acknowledged to be a ''difficulty'', and a ''mystery'' that we cannot comprehend. But had this question been considered with due attention, what has been called a ''difficulty'' would, I doubt not, have been deemed an ''impossibility''; or such a mystery as that of the bread and wine in the Lord's supper, becoming the real body and blood of Christ, or that of each of the three persons in the Trinity being equally God, and yet there being no more Gods than one; which in the eye of common sense, are not properly ''difficulties'', or ''mysteries'', but direct ''contradictions''; such as that of a thing ''being'' and ''not being'' at the same time.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 81}}

==The Mind==

In the same manner that the soul is thought to be immaterial, it is also thought that the human mind is immaterial and that it also exists ''distinct from the body''.

{{quote|According to Descartes, minds and bodies are distinct kinds of substance. Bodies, he held, are spatially extended substances, incapable of feeling or thought; minds, in contrast, are unextended, thinking, feeling substances... ''If minds and bodies are radically different kinds of substance, however, it is not easy to see how they could causally interact''|Wikipedia|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem Mind Body Problem]}}

The problem with separating the mind from the body philosophically is that it contradicts empirical evidence.

{{quote|There is no instance of any man retaining the faculty of thinking, when his brain was destroyed; and whenever that faculty is impeded, or injured, there is sufficient reason to believe that the brain is disordered in proportion; and therefore we are necessarily led to consider the latter as the seat of the former... Moreover, as the faculty of thinking in general ripens, and comes to maturity with the body, it is also observed to decay with it; and if, in some cases, the mental faculties continue vigorous when the body in general is enfeebled, it is evidently because, in those particular cases, the brain is not much affected by the general cause of weakness.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 47}}

{{quote|The notion, therefore, of the ''possibility'' of thinking in man, without an organized body, is not only destitute of all evidence from actual appearances, but is directly contrary to them; and yet these appearances ought alone to guide the judgement of philosophers.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 54}}

In other words, the proposition that the mind exists distinct from the body leads to that gross conclusion that when the body enters a vegetative state the mind becomes its prisoner. 

Futhermore, the immaterial soul and the immaterial mind suffer from the same problem of commonality.

{{quote|The absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non-physical mind and its physical extension has proven problematic to dualism|Wikipedia|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem Mind Body Problem]}}

{{quote|There is no scientific evidence that there is any measurable manifestation of a consciousness or soul which is separate from neural activity|Wikipedia|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_projection Astral projection]}}

==Immortality==

It is commonly thought that the soul of man is immortal. 

{{quote|The only reason why it has been so earnestly contended for, that there is some principle in man that is not material, is that it might subsist, and be capable of sensation and action, when the body was dead|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 55}}

The Jews don't believe in the immortality of the soul which is puzzling seeing all the time that God spent with them. He told them all the complex legal rituals they should perform toward him, but forgot to describe something as simple as what constitutes the nature of man.

{{quote|Almost all forms of Judaism do not share the traditional majority Christian belief in the immortality of the soul|Wikipedia|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_Hell Problem of Hell]}}

==Christianity==

The writings ascribed to Moses paint the world in a natural philosophy that is gradually replaced by later ages with spiritual one. Only in the Christian ages does spiritual philosophy reach its zenith.

{{quote|The first corruptions of Christianity were derived from heathenism, and especially form the principles of the oriental philosophy; and there are similar austeries at this very day among the Hindoos. Their notion that the ''soul is a distinct substance from the body'', and ''that the latter is only a prison and clog to the former'', naturally leads them to extenuate and mortify the body, in order to exalt and purify the soul. Hence came the idea of the great use and value of fasting, of abstinence from marriage, and of voluntary pain and torture; til at length it became a maxim, that the man who could contrive to make himself the most miserable here, secures to himself a greater share of happiness hereafter.|Priestley, Joseph.|An History of the Corruptions on Christianity p. 205}}

It was in the fourth century A.D. that Christian philosophies first proposed that the soul was capable of existing outside of the body.

{{quote|In the fourth century, Christians were concerned that Jesus had not returned and wondered what happened to those who died before the Second Coming of Christ. Christians, led by Augustine of Hippo and under the influence of both gnosticism and neoplatonism, developed a new belief in the soul as capable of a separate existence abstract from the material world. The human souls, unlike those of animals, would survive death and, depending on God's judgment, be transferred to the non-material realms of heaven or hell and the new realm of limbo for unbaptized persons and purgatory for those who do not deserve hell but are not purified for heaven..|Wikipedia|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_religion Natural Religion]}}

==Scriptures==

Most of the instances in the scriptures where the English translators used the ''soul'' can just as equally be translated as ''life''. That the word ''soul'' exists in the bible is not proof that souls exists or that humans have souls. In fact, no where in the entire bible does it define what constitutes a soul. Neither does it define what constitutes a ''spirit'' or relate how a soul and spirit differ from one another. 

{{quote|The word nephish which our translators have here rendered soul, is a common Hebrew word for life, and is very often so rendered.|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry p. 30}}

{{quote|The phrase, &quot;both soul and body,&quot; is a mere Hebrew idiom, to express the whole man or person|Balfour, Walter|Inquiry p. 149}}

====1 Thessalonians 5:23====

This is probably the most notable verse that is used in support of their being three parts in man; and that concept is used as justification by the orthodox for their being three in one God.

{{quote|Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, ''soul'', and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.|1 Thessalonians 5:23 NKJV}}

The apostle Paul traveled extensively and was most likely familiar with many Jewish fables &lt;ref&gt;2 Timothy 3:8-9&lt;/ref&gt; and Gentile philosophies. 

{{quote|Also, when the apostle Paul, 1 Thess. v. 23. says, I pray God your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved blameless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, he only uses these terms as denoting, in the philosophy of his time (which had spread even among the Jews) all that constituted a complete man, without hinting at the possibility of any separation of the several parts.|Priestley, Joseph|[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1141444W/Disquisitions_relating_to_matter_and_spirit Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit] p. 169}}

== Bodily Soul ==

A soul ''existing distinct from the body'' has been discussed above at length. A soul ''existing within the body'' is suggested as a possibility by Aristotle, 

{{quote|In sum, Aristotle saw the relation between soul and body as uncomplicated, in the same way that it is uncomplicated that a cubical shape is a property of a toy building block. The soul is a property exhibited by the body, one among many. Moreover, ''Aristotle proposed that when the body perishes, so does the soul, just as the shape of a building block disappears with destruction of the block.''|Wikipedia|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem Mind Body Problem]}}

I cannot find any basis for a soul existing within the body. The reason being that there exists no organ or part properly called the soul within the body according to our knowledge of human anatomy. Until somebody can identify it within the realm of the body, I am inclined to say that mankind has no such soul. And the thought of a material soul is so different from what is commonly thought of as a soul that if one did exist, it should properly be called something else.

I used to believe that the book of proverbs contained wisdom that was far beyond the capabilities of any human to comprehend and that it was only unlocked through spiritual enlightenment. 

I have since realized that the ancients had a particular understanding of the way the world worked and that that understanding was primitive compared to the understanding we have now. They were ignorant of certain things that we've since discovered, and that likewise we are ignorant of certain things that future generations will discover. The common knowledge of those days was different from the common knowledge of these days and because of that the context of many sayings is unknown to modern day readers. 

{{quote|An appeal to authority is an appeal to one's sense of modesty, which is to say, an appeal to the feeling that others are more knowledgeable. A type of appeal to irrelevant authority is the appeal to ancient wisdom, where something is

The sayings of the ancients like themselves are ancient. And the older a thing is does not necessarily mean it is wiser. It is the complete knowledge of a thing that makes us wiser about it; where we have clear and distinct ideas of the subject matter and have examined every argument concerning it. Wise sayings are not arguments for or against a particular stance, rather they are the opinions of human beings who were held in high regard by the society in which they lived in for the mental faculties they possessed. It is only when these opinions are applied to the nature of things can their validity be assessed. 

Saying a thing is so, is no longer enough for people to believe; whether it be from a powerful government, a divine book, or a wise man - it must be objectively proven to be so.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18507">The doctrine of the trinity describes ''an essential union of a divine and human nature, and a supposed union of three distinct created spirits'':

{{quotation|They both confess, that there is no exact representation, no perfect example of any such union in nature, and yet they will be representing it over and over again; sometimes by a tree and its branches, sometimes by the sun and its light, sometimes by a mind and its faculties, sometimes by body and soul; and that nothing may be wanting in them towards the representation of it, they represent it at length by that which is not; an essential union of a divine and human nature, and by a supposed union of three distinct created spirits.|Animadversions|Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 273}}

== Examining the Unions ==

The natural inquiry concerning the unions with-in the trinity Godhead is,

{{quote|How three (distinct, several, individual) divine beings, essences, or substances, should remain three several individual substances, and yet at the same time be united into one divine substance, called God?|Howe, Calm and Sober Enquiry concerning the Possibility of a Divine Revelation|Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 283}}

In order to try to comprehend the unions between the distinct spirits or substances we can summarize them by representing them as premises to an argument and examining them using logic&lt;ref&gt;Vallicella, Bill. [http://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2010/01/is-the-doctrine-of-the-trinity-logically-coherent-peter-lupu.html Is The Doctrine of the Trinity Logically Coherent?]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first premise being,

* FATHER is not SON
* SON is not HOLYGHOST
* HOLYGHOST is not FATHER

The second premise being,

* FATHER is God
* SON is God
* HOLYGHOST is God

And the conclusion of the argument being that God is a trinity. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, such an argument is not structurally sound because the [[Incompatible Premises|premises are not compatible]] with one another.

{{quote|Another structural feature of an argument that could render it fatally flawed would be one whose premises are ''incompatible'' with one another. And an argument that has such premises is one from which ''any conclusion, no matter how outrageous, can be drawn''.|T. Edward Damer|Attacking Faulty Reasoning}}

This can be more easily seen when the premises are simplified:

* FATHER is not SON is not HOLYGHOST
* FATHER is SON is HOLYGHOST

What the doctrine of the trinity is proposing is an argument where its two main premises contradict one another. If the doctrine of the trinity is a logical doctrine then both of the above premises when taken together would be true. However, it is not possible for both statements to be simultaneously true because they contradict one another and contradict a fundamental law of ontology, the Law of Noncontradiction. 

{{quote|On what principle of philosophy, or by what rule of language, can it be correct to say, that the Father is a divine person, the Son is a divine person, and the Holy Ghost is a divine person, and therefore there are three divine persons; and yet, when it is asserted, that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, it should at the same time be denied, that there are three Gods?|Two Letters touching the Trinity and Incarnation|Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 240}}

=== Examining the Numbers ===

To try and restate the entire argument around numbers instead of persons we end up with the same result. Given no other information, what should the natural conclusion to these two premises be:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Premise 1: God is one&lt;br /&gt;
Premise 2: God is three&lt;br&gt;
Conclusion: ?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The natural conclusion is two conclusions taken together that are just as contradictory as the proposition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Conclusion 1: God is one&lt;br /&gt;
Conclusion 2: God is three&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words it is just as EQUALLY valid to draw from those two premises that ''God is three'' as it is to draw from them that ''God is one''. If the conclusion of any argument for the number of God SHOULD BE that ''God is one'', then any additional proposals or premises for any other number for God are irrelevant and the need for a doctrine to explain what ''God is one'' means is unnecessary. In other words, if the goal is to preach that ''God is one'', why then confuse the minds of men with notions that God is anything other than one?

== Ontology ==

Aristole set forth the most fundamental principle of logic called the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction Law of Noncontradiction] when he stated that, &quot;it is impossible for anything at the same time to be and not to be.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Aristole M 4.4.1006a&lt;/ref&gt; Restated another way, &quot;it is impossible that contradictory statements be simultaneously true.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;McDowell, Josh. The New Evidence That Demands A Verdict pp. 600-601. Regis, E. 388-89.&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine of the trinity violates this important principle because it attempts to be ''simultaneously that which it is and that which it is not''.

'''One Yet Simultaneously Many'''

It is not logically possible according to the Law of Noncontradiction for God to be ''one spirit'' and simultaneously ''three distinct spirits''; to assert otherwise would be to assert that the nature of God is contradictory in nature. 

Can the human mind even comprehend a contradictory God existing as ''Indivisible'' and yet simultaneously ''Divisible''; ''One'' yet ''Three''? If we say that God is ''One'' and then say that that ''One'' is a unity of ''Three'' Somewhats, we have already broken down in thought our conceptualization of God as ''One''.

{{quote|But what is it that is thus pretended to be impossible? ‘Tis but this, that there be Three Somewhats, which are but One God: and these Somewhats we commonly call Persons.|Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 208}}

{{quote|I now perceive that it has always been impossible to make one of three, or three of one, - one perfect and infinite being equal to three perfect and infinite beings. There may be gifted minds capable of comprehending this doctrine, but such is not mine. It is plain to me now that I have all my life been worshipping three distinct beings; never having been able, with the most strenuous efforts, to combine the three in my own mind so far as to form a simple idea.|Mary Dana|Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 2}}

In the study of ''parts'', known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereology Merelogy], the ancient philosophers such as Aristole first developed part-whole reasoning with axioms such as &quot;the whole is a sum of its parts&quot;. When that field of study and reasoning is applied to the trinity, the proposition that the trinity sets forth can be described as &quot;the whole is a sum of its parts and each part is the whole sum&quot;. 

However, such a proposition is only plausible if the remedial meanings of the words ''whole'' and ''part'' are abandoned and mystical ones take their place. In this mystification, the ''whole'' of God is likened to the Godhead and the ''parts'' of God are likened to Persons, Beings, Intellects, Spirits, Properties, Characteristics, Manifestations, Subsistences.

{{quote|They are so far from agreeing, that they are infinitely divided among themselves;... whether it be a Trinity of Minds, Essences, Somewhats, Attributes, Faculties, Modes, External Denominations, or what not, which is to be adored.|Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 288}}

Often times it is responded that the doctrine of the trinity does not violate the Law of Noncontradiction because the &quot;sense&quot; of the two premises of God being one and God being many are not equal. They say, in one sense God is one in essence and in another sense he is three in Persons. Such responses only try to circumvent the obvious contradiction by mystifying the distinction between the two premises and in doing so making the proposition harder to conceptualize. 

'''Fully Human Yet Simultaneously Fully Divine'''

The primary claim of the trinity of a &quot;supposed union of three distinct spirits&quot; has over the course of Church history developed hand-in-hand with it's secondary claim of a &quot;supposed union of divine and human natures&quot; also known as the doctrine of the incarnation of Christ. However, an essential union of truly divine and truly human natures is an ontological and mereological impossibility as stated according to the antisemmetry postulate,

{{quote|Two distinct things cannot be part of each other.|Achille Varzi|[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mereology/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Merelogy]}}

Opposite natures cannot be joined while remaining in opposition; a house divided cannot stand &lt;ref&gt;Mark 3:25&lt;/ref&gt;. The Scriptures state that God is spirit &lt;ref&gt;John 4:24&lt;/ref&gt; and that man is flesh &lt;ref&gt;Genesis 6:3&lt;/ref&gt;, which is to say, that the substance of God is incorruptible and the substance of man is corruptible. According to Paul, it is not possible for incorruption to wed corruption, and likewise neither can both incorruption and corruption simultaneously co-habit the same Being. Nor is it possible for the co-habitation of an infinite nature with a finite one. If the natures of God and man are so diabolically opposed it is therefore not possible for God to inhabit the body of a man or vice versa. Yet, this is the claim made by the doctrine of the trinity and incarnation: that two opposing, contradictory natures can co-exist simultaneously with-in the whole of God.

== Mysticism ==

It is important to understand the doctrine of the trinity because it claims to describes &quot;who&quot; and &quot;what&quot; God is. Yet, even today the trinity is classified as a ''mystery'' of the Christian faith &lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity Trinity]&lt;/ref&gt;. To try and better understand this mystery, we can take a look at its origins or rather the introduction of it into the Christian religion by the early &quot;church fathers&quot;. 

{{quote|The first corruptions of Christianity were derived from heathenism, and especially from the principles of the oriental philosophy.|Joseph Priestley|An History of the Corruptions of Christianity p. 205}}

Many of the early church fathers read the philosophies of Plato.

{{quote|Platonism influenced Christianity through Clement of Alexandria and Origen, and the Cappadocian Fathers. St. Augustine was heavily influenced by Platonism as well.|Wikipedia|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism Platonism]}}

By the third century Plato's teachings were combined with mysticism to form Neoplatonism and at the First Council of Nicaea 325 A.D were canonized along with the doctrine of the trinity.

{{quote|In the third century, Plotinus recast Plato's system, establishing Neoplatonism, in which Middle Platonism was fused with mysticism.|Wikipedia|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism Platonism]}}

{{quote|The link between mysticism and the vision of the Divine was introduced by the early Church Fathers, who used the term as an adjective, as in mystical theology and mystical contemplation.|Wikipedia|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mysticism Christian Mysticism]}}

{{quote|The doctrines of the Trinity and Incarnation have no solid or good foundation in revelation or scripture... They are of paganick or heathen descent and origin, and were introduced into the Church by Platonick philosophers, when they came over to Christianity.|Arthur Bury, The Naked Gospel|Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I pp. 238-239}}

In 600 A.D. the impossibility of the doctrine of the trinity and the abuses of the Church gave rise to the Muslim religion.

{{quote|As the Trinity, when first brought into the Church by the Platonists, did, by its natural absurdity and impossibility, give a check and stop to the progress of the gospel; so ever since it has served to propagate Dieism and Atheism, and to hinder the conversion of the Jews and Mahometans and the heathen nations not yet turned to Christianity.|Arthur Bury, The Naked Gospel|Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I pp. 238-239}}

Even after the reformation many reformed churches still held a belief in the doctrine of the trinity. It was not until the age of enlightenment and founding of the United States that this belief was fully exposed. 

{{quote|It is too late in the day for men of sincerity to pretend they believe in the Platonic mysticisms that three are one, and one is three; and yet that the one is not three, and the three are not one... But this constitutes the craft, the power and the profit of the priests.|Thomas Jefferson to John Adams 1813}}

The doctrine of the trinity and the scriptures themselves oppose one another. If the scriptures are the revelation and light of God then the trinity has no place in them because the trinity is still a secret, it is still a mystery - it serves no purpose other than to confuse the minds of men. If logic is consistency and noncontradiction then paradox is the opposite: inconsistency and contradiction. As has been shown so far, the trinity is a contradiction, or rather a paradox and it is mysticism, through experience, that embraces paradoxes, ambiguities, and contradictions &lt;ref&gt;McDowell, Josh. The New Evidence That Demands A Verdict p. 647&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Barbara. [http://buddhism.about.com/b/2010/10/07/the-paradox-of-paradoxes.htm The Paradox of Paradoxes]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Knowing God ==

If God is a trinity, and the trinity is a mystery, then it can be logically concluded that those that worship the triune God worship what they do not know.

{{quote|What the ''mystical'' divines teach, cannot be called an explication; they deny all explications; we must say therefore ‘tis Samaritanism; for what our Savior says of the Samaritans, by way of reproof and blame, that these gentlemen profess concerning themselves, that ''they worship they know not what''.&quot;|Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 265}}

If a man worships what he does not know, then it is not ever possible for him to come to a knowledge of what he worships. But we know in the Scriptures that it is possible to come to a knowledge of God &lt;ref&gt;Colossians 1:10&lt;/ref&gt;. The dispute is not whether or not God is completely knowable, the dispute is whether or not he exists as a contradiction which it is not even possible to come to the knowledge of.

In three-valued logic there exists three truth values, true, false, and indeterminate &lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic Three-valued logic]&lt;/ref&gt;. Since the logic of the trinity does not evaluate to a true proposition or a false proposition, it can therefore be classified as an unknown. Paul said of the unknown God:

{{quote|I found also an erection on which had been inscribed: To God—unknown; whom, therefore—not knowing—ye do worship, this One I announce to you.|Acts 17:22 YLT}}

== Biblical Support ==

The scope of the trinity is outside of the bible because no where does it ''plainly'' and ''clearly'' teach that God is a trinity. If it were an essential doctrine that God should exist as a singleton and at the same time exist a composition, reason demands that an explication should be given by Christ or his Apostles, yet there is no single chapter dedicated to the topic. Even though the argument has been used many times before and is often scoffed at by the orthodox -- the word ''trinity'' cannot even be found in the bible. And neither will you find the terms ''God the Son'', or ''God the Holy Ghost''. Out of all the 66 books of the bible not once will you find any of those terms mentioned. The only support that the trinity has found for itself in the Scriptures is found through inference, allusion, and translational bias.

== Biblical Inconsistency == 

The ramification of the doctrine of the trinity is that Christ is God Almighty, but if that were the case then:

# God would have died at that hand of man
# God would have anointed God
# God would have raised God up
# God would have received God into heaven where he already existed
# God would sit God at his own right hand &lt;ref&gt;Ephesians 1:20&lt;/ref&gt;
# God would be his own high priest &lt;ref&gt;Hebrews 6:20&lt;/ref&gt;
# God would be both the mediated and the mediator between God and man&lt;ref&gt;1 Timothy 2:5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conclusion == 

Christ was a man and there are many instances in the scripture where he is called such. He walked the earth with the same nature, in personhood, that every man has. He differed only in his nature according to his actions, which were divine -- in that he did the works of God -- and in this alone did he display the nature of God. His soul did not pre-exist his body in the same way that our souls do not pre-exist our own bodies. He was separate from God in substance in the same way that we are separate from God in substance. He was made of a corruptible body in the same way that we are made of a corruptible body. The scriptures depict him shedding that corruptible body in honor of God and being rewarded by God with an incorruptible body and further made the lord over all things under God.

{{quote|For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the ''man'' Christ Jesus;|1 Timothy 2:5 KJV|[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy+2:5&amp;version=KJV BibleGateway]}}

== After Thoughts ==

I must say that if it weren't for the ''supposed'' notion of souls the scriptures would appear much less confusing and the doctrine of the trinity probably would not have been conjured up to explain the confusion.

It is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another, that is carried on in a different place, and with quite different tools... A man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another. When he first begins the new work he is seldom very keen and hearty; his mind, as they say, does not go to it, and for some time he rather trifles than applies to good purpose. The habit of sauntering and of indolent careless application, which is naturally, or rather necessarily, acquired by every country workman who is obliged to change his work and his tools every half hour, and to apply his hand in twenty different ways almost always slothful and alazy, and incapable of any vigorous application even on the most pressing occasions.|Wealth of Nations Vol I p. 13-14}}

In almost every other race of animals, each individual, when it is grown up to maturity, is entirely independent, and in its natural state has occasion for the assistance of no other living creature. But man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail if he can interest their self-love in his favour, and show them that it is for their own advantage to do for him what he requires of them.|Wealth of Nations Vol I p. 21}}

{{quote|The word VALUE, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys. The one may be called &quot;value in use;&quot; the other, &quot;value in exchange&quot;. The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; and on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use. Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarce any thing; scarce any thing  can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it.|Wealth of Nations Vol I p. 42}}

{{quote|The value of any commodity, therefore, to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or command.

{{quote|The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of it.

{{quote|Princes and sovereign states have frequently fancied that they had a temporary interest to diminish the quantity of pure metal contained in their coins; but they seldom have fancied that they had any to augment it.

{{quote|In England, gold was not considered as a legal tender for a long time after it was coined into money. The proportion between the values of gold and silver money was not fixed by any public law or proclamation; but was left to be settled by the market.

{{quote|In process of time, and as people become gradually more familiar with the use of different metals in coin, and consequently better acquainted with the proportion between their respective values, it has in most countries, I believe, been found convenient to ascertain this proportion, and to declare by a public law that a guinea, for example, of such a weight and fineness, should exchange for one-and-twenty shillings, or be a legal tender for a debt of that amount.|Wealth of Nations Vol I p. 59}}
