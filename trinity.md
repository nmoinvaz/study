Trinity
=======

The doctrine of the trinity describes *an essential union of a divine and human nature, and a supposed union of three distinct created spirits*:

<quote><cite>They both confess, that there is no exact representation, no perfect example of any such union in nature, and yet they will be representing it over and over again; sometimes by a tree and its branches, sometimes by the sun and its light, sometimes by a mind and its faculties, sometimes by body and soul; and that nothing may be wanting in them towards the representation of it, they represent it at length by that which is not; an essential union of a divine and human nature, and by a supposed union of three distinct created spirits.</cite><span>— <author>Animadversions</author>, <book>Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 273</book></span></quote>

Examining the Unions
--------------------

The natural inquiry concerning the unions with-in the trinity Godhead is,

<quote><cite>How three (distinct, several, individual) divine beings, essences, or substances, should remain three several individual substances, and yet at the same time be united into one divine substance, called God?</cite><span>— <author>Howe, Calm and Sober Enquiry concerning the Possibility of a Divine Revelation</author>, <book>Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 283</book></span></quote>

In order to try to comprehend the unions between the distinct spirits or substances we can summarize them by representing them as premises to an argument and examining them using logic[^1].

> The first premise being,
>
> -   FATHER is not SON
> -   SON is not HOLYGHOST
> -   HOLYGHOST is not FATHER
>
> The second premise being,
>
> -   FATHER is God
> -   SON is God
> -   HOLYGHOST is God
>
> And the conclusion of the argument being that God is a trinity.

However, such an argument is not structurally sound because the [premises are not compatible](Incompatible_Premises "wikilink") with one another.

<quote><cite>Another structural feature of an argument that could render it fatally flawed would be one whose premises are <i>incompatible</i> with one another. And an argument that has such premises is one from which <i>any conclusion, no matter how outrageous, can be drawn</i>.</cite><span>— <author>T. Edward Damer</author>, <book>Attacking Faulty Reasoning</book></span></quote>

This can be more easily seen when the premises are simplified:

-   FATHER is not SON is not HOLYGHOST
-   FATHER is SON is HOLYGHOST

What the doctrine of the trinity is proposing is an argument where its two main premises contradict one another. If the doctrine of the trinity is a logical doctrine then both of the above premises when taken together would be true. However, it is not possible for both statements to be simultaneously true because they contradict one another and contradict a fundamental law of ontology, the Law of Noncontradiction.

<quote><cite>On what principle of philosophy, or by what rule of language, can it be correct to say, that the Father is a divine person, the Son is a divine person, and the Holy Ghost is a divine person, and therefore there are three divine persons; and yet, when it is asserted, that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, it should at the same time be denied, that there are three Gods?</cite><span>— <author>Two Letters touching the Trinity and Incarnation</author>, <book>Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 240</book></span></quote>

### Examining the Numbers

To try and restate the entire argument around numbers instead of persons we end up with the same result. Given no other information, what should the natural conclusion to these two premises be:

> Premise 1: God is one<br>
> Premise 2: God is three<br>
> Conclusion: ?

The natural conclusion is two conclusions taken together that are just as contradictory as the proposition:

> Conclusion 1: God is one<br>
> Conclusion 2: God is three

In other words it is just as EQUALLY valid to draw from those two premises that *God is three* as it is to draw from them that *God is one*. If the conclusion of any argument for the number of God SHOULD BE that *God is one*, then any additional proposals or premises for any other number for God are irrelevant and the need for a doctrine to explain what *God is one* means is unnecessary. In other words, if the goal is to preach that *God is one*, why then confuse the minds of men with notions that God is anything other than one?

Ontology
--------

Aristole set forth the most fundamental principle of logic called the [Law of Noncontradiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction) when he stated that, “it is impossible for anything at the same time to be and not to be.” [^2] Restated another way, “it is impossible that contradictory statements be simultaneously true.” [^3] The doctrine of the trinity violates this important principle because it attempts to be *simultaneously that which it is and that which it is not*.

**One Yet Simultaneously Many**

It is not logically possible according to the Law of Noncontradiction for God to be *one spirit* and simultaneously *three distinct spirits*; to assert otherwise would be to assert that the nature of God is contradictory in nature.

Can the human mind even comprehend a contradictory God existing as *Indivisible* and yet simultaneously *Divisible*; *One* yet *Three*? If we say that God is *One* and then say that that *One* is a unity of *Three* Somewhats, we have already broken down in thought our conceptualization of God as *One*.

<quote><cite>But what is it that is thus pretended to be impossible? ‘Tis but this, that there be Three Somewhats, which are but One God: and these Somewhats we commonly call Persons.</cite><span>— <author>Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 208</author></span></quote>

<quote><cite>I now perceive that it has always been impossible to make one of three, or three of one, - one perfect and infinite being equal to three perfect and infinite beings. There may be gifted minds capable of comprehending this doctrine, but such is not mine. It is plain to me now that I have all my life been worshipping three distinct beings; never having been able, with the most strenuous efforts, to combine the three in my own mind so far as to form a simple idea.</cite><span>— <author>Mary Dana</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 2</book></span></quote>

In the study of *parts*, known as [Merelogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereology), the ancient philosophers such as Aristole first developed part-whole reasoning with axioms such as “the whole is a sum of its parts”. When that field of study and reasoning is applied to the trinity, the proposition that the trinity sets forth can be described as “the whole is a sum of its parts and each part is the whole sum”.

However, such a proposition is only plausible if the remedial meanings of the words *whole* and *part* are abandoned and mystical ones take their place. In this mystification, the *whole* of God is likened to the Godhead and the *parts* of God are likened to Persons, Beings, Intellects, Spirits, Properties, Characteristics, Manifestations, Subsistences.

<quote><cite>They are so far from agreeing, that they are infinitely divided among themselves;... whether it be a Trinity of Minds, Essences, Somewhats, Attributes, Faculties, Modes, External Denominations, or what not, which is to be adored.</cite><span>— <author>Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 288</author></span></quote>

Often times it is responded that the doctrine of the trinity does not violate the Law of Noncontradiction because the “sense” of the two premises of God being one and God being many are not equal. They say, in one sense God is one in essence and in another sense he is three in Persons. Such responses only try to circumvent the obvious contradiction by mystifying the distinction between the two premises and in doing so making the proposition harder to conceptualize.

**Fully Human Yet Simultaneously Fully Divine**

The primary claim of the trinity of a “supposed union of three distinct spirits” has over the course of Church history developed hand-in-hand with it's secondary claim of a “supposed union of divine and human natures” also known as the doctrine of the incarnation of Christ. However, an essential union of truly divine and truly human natures is an ontological and mereological impossibility as stated according to the antisemmetry postulate,

<quote><cite>Two distinct things cannot be part of each other.</cite><span>— <author>Achille Varzi</author>, <book><a href='http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mereology/'>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Merelogy</a></book></span></quote>

Opposite natures cannot be joined while remaining in opposition; a house divided cannot stand [^4]. The Scriptures state that God is spirit [^5] and that man is flesh [^6], which is to say, that the substance of God is incorruptible and the substance of man is corruptible. According to Paul, it is not possible for incorruption to wed corruption, and likewise neither can both incorruption and corruption simultaneously co-habit the same Being. Nor is it possible for the co-habitation of an infinite nature with a finite one. If the natures of God and man are so diabolically opposed it is therefore not possible for God to inhabit the body of a man or vice versa. Yet, this is the claim made by the doctrine of the trinity and incarnation: that two opposing, contradictory natures can co-exist simultaneously with-in the whole of God.

<quote><cite>On the other hand, the small number of texts which are brought forward as evidence of the deity of our Lord, can be explained without doing such violence to our reason, as the doctrine of two complete natures in one person – one infinite and the other finite – always must.</cite><span>— <author>Mary Dana</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 6</book></span></quote>

Mysticism
---------

It is important to understand the doctrine of the trinity because it claims to describes “who” and “what” God is. Yet, even today the trinity is classified as a *mystery* of the Christian faith [^7]. To try and better understand this mystery, we can take a look at its origins or rather the introduction of it into the Christian religion by the early “church fathers”.

<quote><cite>The first corruptions of Christianity were derived from heathenism, and especially from the principles of the oriental philosophy.</cite><span>— <author>Joseph Priestley</author>, <book>An History of the Corruptions of Christianity p. 205</book></span></quote>

Many of the early church fathers read the philosophies of Plato.

<quote><cite>Platonism influenced Christianity through Clement of Alexandria and Origen, and the Cappadocian Fathers. St. Augustine was heavily influenced by Platonism as well.</cite><span>— <author>Wikipedia</author>, <book><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism'>Platonism</a></book></span></quote>

By the third century Plato's teachings were combined with mysticism to form Neoplatonism and at the First Council of Nicaea 325 A.D were canonized along with the doctrine of the trinity.

<quote><cite>In the third century, Plotinus recast Plato's system, establishing Neoplatonism, in which Middle Platonism was fused with mysticism.</cite><span>— <author>Wikipedia</author>, <book><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism'>Platonism</a></book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The link between mysticism and the vision of the Divine was introduced by the early Church Fathers, who used the term as an adjective, as in mystical theology and mystical contemplation.</cite><span>— <author>Wikipedia</author>, <book><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mysticism'>Christian Mysticism</a></book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The doctrines of the Trinity and Incarnation have no solid or good foundation in revelation or scripture... They are of paganick or heathen descent and origin, and were introduced into the Church by Platonick philosophers, when they came over to Christianity.</cite><span>— <author>Arthur Bury, The Naked Gospel</author>, <book>Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I pp. 238-239</book></span></quote>

In 600 A.D. the impossibility of the doctrine of the trinity and the abuses of the Church gave rise to the Muslim religion.

<quote><cite>As the Trinity, when first brought into the Church by the Platonists, did, by its natural absurdity and impossibility, give a check and stop to the progress of the gospel; so ever since it has served to propagate Dieism and Atheism, and to hinder the conversion of the Jews and Mahometans and the heathen nations not yet turned to Christianity.</cite><span>— <author>Arthur Bury, The Naked Gospel</author>, <book>Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I pp. 238-239</book></span></quote>

Even after the reformation many reformed churches still held a belief in the doctrine of the trinity. It was not until the age of enlightenment and founding of the United States that this belief was fully exposed.

<quote><cite>It is too late in the day for men of sincerity to pretend they believe in the Platonic mysticisms that three are one, and one is three; and yet that the one is not three, and the three are not one... But this constitutes the craft, the power and the profit of the priests.</cite><span>— <author>Thomas Jefferson to John Adams 1813</author></span></quote>

The doctrine of the trinity and the scriptures themselves oppose one another. If the scriptures are the revelation and light of God then the trinity has no place in them because the trinity is still a secret, it is still a mystery - it serves no purpose other than to confuse the minds of men. If logic is consistency and noncontradiction then paradox is the opposite: inconsistency and contradiction. As has been shown so far, the trinity is a contradiction, or rather a paradox and it is mysticism, through experience, that embraces paradoxes, ambiguities, and contradictions [^8][^9].

Knowing God
-----------

If God is a trinity, and the trinity is a mystery, then it can be logically concluded that those that worship the triune God worship what they do not know.

<quote><cite>What the <i>mystical</i> divines teach, cannot be called an explication; they deny all explications; we must say therefore ‘tis Samaritanism; for what our Savior says of the Samaritans, by way of reproof and blame, that these gentlemen profess concerning themselves, that <i>they worship they know not what</i>."</cite><span>— <author>Antitrinitarian Biography Vol I p. 265</author></span></quote>

If a man worships what he does not know, then it is not ever possible for him to come to a knowledge of what he worships. But we know in the Scriptures that it is possible to come to a knowledge of God [^10]. The dispute is not whether or not God is completely knowable, the dispute is whether or not he exists as a contradiction which it is not even possible to come to the knowledge of.

In three-valued logic there exists three truth values, true, false, and indeterminate [^11]. Since the logic of the trinity does not evaluate to a true proposition or a false proposition, it can therefore be classified as an unknown. Paul said of the unknown God:

<quote><cite>I found also an erection on which had been inscribed: To God—unknown; whom, therefore—not knowing—ye do worship, this One I announce to you.</cite><span>— <author>Acts 17:22 YLT</author></span></quote>

Biblical Support
----------------

The scope of the trinity is outside of the bible because no where does it *plainly* and *clearly* teach that God is a trinity. If it were an essential doctrine that God should exist as a singleton and at the same time exist a composition, reason demands that an explication should be given by Christ or his Apostles, yet there is no single chapter dedicated to the topic. Even though the argument has been used many times before and is often scoffed at by the orthodox -- the word *trinity* cannot even be found in the bible. And neither will you find the terms *God the Son*, or *God the Holy Ghost*. Out of all the 66 books of the bible not once will you find any of those terms mentioned. The only support that the trinity has found for itself in the Scriptures is found through inference, allusion, and translational bias.

Biblical Inconsistency
----------------------

The ramification of the doctrine of the trinity is that Christ is God Almighty, but if that were the case then:

1.  God would have died at that hand of man
2.  God would have anointed God
3.  God would have raised God up
4.  God would have received God into heaven where he already existed
5.  God would sit God at his own right hand [^12]
6.  God would be his own high priest [^13]
7.  God would be both the mediated and the mediator between God and man[^14]

Conclusion
----------

Christ was a man and there are many instances in the scripture where he is called such. He walked the earth with the same nature, in personhood, that every man has. He differed only in his nature according to his actions, which were divine -- in that he did the works of God -- and in this alone did he display the nature of God. His soul did not pre-exist his body in the same way that our souls do not pre-exist our own bodies. He was separate from God in substance in the same way that we are separate from God in substance. He was made of a corruptible body in the same way that we are made of a corruptible body. The scriptures depict him shedding that corruptible body in honor of God and being rewarded by God with an incorruptible body and further made the lord over all things under God.

After Thoughts
--------------

I must say that if it weren't for the *supposed* notion of souls the scriptures would appear much less confusing and the doctrine of the trinity probably would not have been conjured up to explain the confusion.

Still I held it, as it seems to me all must do, as a strange mystery, which I must not attempt to comprehend</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 2</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>From this address &lsqb;John 20:28&rsqb; of Thomas, many commentators are of the opinion, that the doctrine of Christ’s divine nature may be established, and conceive that the sentence, when filled up, would be thus: ‘I am not faithless; I doubt no longer; thou art my Lord and my God.’ But, on the contrary, others justly observe, that Thomas used the term God in the sense in which it is applied to kings and judges, who were considered as representatives of Deity, and preeminently to the Messiah.</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 22</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Again, he says, that they who style themselves orthodox “constantly assert, that the will, power and wisdom of the whole Trinity is one and the same; and that what one wills, does, and knows, they all will do and know, by virtue of this unity of essence.” Again, “that where the numerical essence is one and the same, the will and actions of that essence must be one and the same. And where the will and actions are numerically distinct and diverse, there the individual essence must also be distinct and different. And this Damascen declares to be the doctrine of the holy Fathers. Hence, it demonstratively follows, that of the essence of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, be numerically one and the same, the will and all the other actions of these three, must be numerically one and the same; so that, what the Father wills and does, the Son and Holy Ghost must will and do also… If the three persons in the Trinity have one mind and will, how could Christ say he came not to do his own will, but the will of him that sent him? “I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which sent me.”</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 30</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Bear in mind also that the term worship… was used in the early ages of the Church with as great latitude as the term God, and did no more <i>always</i> mean <i>supreme</i> homage than the term God <i>always</i> meant the <i>supreme</i> Being. Nebuchadnezzar “fell upon his face and <i>worshipped</i> Daniel,” but not as the supreme God; and the eastern sages worshipped the infant Jesus, but not as the supreme God.</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 33</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>First, that Watts did not believe the Trinity, as usually understood, to be ‘plainly taught in any single text;’ secondly, that in his mind it was not so expressed in the Scriptures at large as to be intelligible to ‘reason and conscience;’ and thirdly, that the ‘strange and perplexing notion of three real persons going to make up one true God,’ is not a ‘necessary and important part of the Christian doctrine,’ whatever may be thought of its reality.</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 54-55</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Namely that the early Fathers did not believe that the Trinity was taught in Scriptures, and that those who believed in and contended for this doctrine themselves, did not receive it as it is received at the present day.</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 54-59</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>Those who receive the doctrine of the Trinity are the persons who are depending upon human reason. It appears to me they fall into two strange and opposite errors. They first construct the doctrine upon inference and human reason, and then they prostrate reason to receive it.</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 78</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>In the New Testament I constantly find that men where commanded to believe that the Messiah was the Son of God; but in the present day a very different faith is required of us. Instead of saying, “I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God,” men are required to say, “I believe that thou art the living God himself.”</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 92</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>I not long ago heard two orthodox divines of the Calvinistic school congratulating themselves upon the perfection of their system, remarking that they prized it because all the parts of it “dovetailed” together so nicely. Yes, Sir, it is certain they do dovetail in a beautiful manner, but it is only as a system of human invention that they do so; they certainly do not harmonize with human reason, nor, it is plain to me, with Scripture; certainly not with the character of God as revealed to us in the Bible.</cite><span>— <author>Dana, Mary</author>, <book>Letters addressed to Relatives and Friends p. 108</book></span></quote>

**Principles of nature**

<quote><cite>If the assertion be made, that one is equal to three, and that three are no more than one, all numerical distinction is totally destroyed, and man consents to become a fool upon the plainest points. Trinitarian declarations are direct contradictions to each other; the part is as great as the whole, and the whole is no greater than the part; three infinites put together make only one, and the destruction of two of them does not diminish the mass of existence or perfection.</cite><span>— <author>Palmer, Elihu</author>, <book>Principles of nature p. 17-18</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>This doctrine of the Trinity, Christianity has borrowed from the ancient heathen ideas, and the church has incorporated it for the purposes of mystery and ecclesiastical imposition. It was found among the reveries of Plato, and being transferred to the followers of Jesus, it has appeared under the modification, and with the names of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Thus modified, it became the foundation of a cruel and ferocious dogma, that external damnation should be the portion of him who called in question this holy mystery.</cite><span>— <author>Palmer, Elihu</author>, <book>Principles of nature p. 18</book></span></quote>

**The Age of Reason**

<quote><cite>As to the Christian system of faith, it appears to me as a species of atheism - a sort of religious denial of God. It professes to believe in a man rather than in God.

**World Religions**

<quote><cite>If Jesus is God, any god can do what he did and forgive his tormentors and so Jesus does not deserve any credit for what he did. On the other hand, if he is an ordinary human being like us with our own frailties and shortcomings, then he deserves to be admired and emulated. By making him a God, the vested interests have taken the shine off the glory of his humanity.</cite><span>— <author>William, Xavier</author>, <book>World Religions KL 7831-7833</book></span></quote>

<quote><cite>The Christian doctrine of the trinity -- Father, Son, and Holy Ghost -- was not formalized until the 4th or 5th century C. E. (A), yet the historical concept of a triune deity is much older than that, with evidence dating from the 7th millenium B.C.E. (B). Even in early Christianity, this trinity had a female member, the Holy Ghost.</cite><span>— <author><a href='http://www.northernway.org/twm/mary/trinity.html'>Mary and the Trinity</a></author></span></quote>
